# Abstract (<= 1 page)

    one page stating what the thesis is about
    highlight the contributions of the thesis

# Chapter 1: Introduction (~5-10 pages)

    - Thesis Statement (one or two sentences)
        What is your thesis about and what have you done?
        If you have a hypothesis what is it?
        How will you test (prove/disprove) your hypothesis?
    - Motivation
        Why is this problem you've worked on important
    - Goals / Objectives
        What are you trying to do and why?
        How will you or the reader know if or when you've met your objectives?
    - **** Contributions *****
        What is new, different, better, significant?
        Why is the world a better place because of what you've done?
        What have you contributed to the field of research?
        What is now known/possible/better because of your thesis?
    Outline of the thesis (optional)

# Chapter 2: Background / Related Work (~8-20 pages)

    More than a literature review
    Organize related work - impose structure
    Be clear as to how previous work being described relates to your own.
    The reader should not be left wondering why you've described something!!
    Critique the existing work - Where is it strong where is it weak? What are the unreasonable/undesirable assumptions?
    Identify opportunities for more research (i.e., your thesis) Are there unaddressed, or more important related topics?
    After reading this chapter, one should understand the motivation for and importance of your thesis
    You should clearly and precisely define all of the key concepts dealt with in the rest of the thesis, and teach the reader what s/he needs to know to understand the rest of the thesis.

# Chapter 3: Theory / Solution / Program / Problem (~15-30 pages)

    continuing from Chapter 2 explain the issues
    outline your solution / extension / refutation

# Chapter 4: Implementation / Formalism (~15-30 pages)

    not every thesis has or needs an implementation

# Chapter 5: Results and Evaluation (~15-30 pages)

    adequacy, efficiency, productiveness, effectiveness (choose your criteria, state them clearly and justify them)
    be careful that you are using a fair measure, and that you are actually measuring what you claim to be measuring
    if comparing with previous techniques those techniques must be described in Chapter 2
    be honest in evaluation
    admit weaknesses

# Chapter 6: Conclusions and Future Work (~5-10 pages)

    State what you've done and what you've found
    Summarize contributions (achievements and impact)
    Outline open issues/directions for future work

# Bibliography / References

    Include references to:
        credit others for their work
        help to distinguish your work from others
        provide pointers to further detailed readings
        support your claims (if evidence can be found in others work)
    Ensure that ALL bibliographic entries are complete including: authors, title, journal or conference, volume and number of journals, date of publication and page numbers. Be careful to at least be consistent in punctuation.
    Learn how to use a good typesetting program that can track and format bibliographic references (e.g., groff, latex, frame).
    Within the text of the thesis, a reference with a number of people can be referred to as Lastname et al. (where et al appears in italics and the al is followed by a period).
    My personal view is that URL's are not valid bibliographic references. They and their contents change and they often contain material that has not been refereed.

# Appendix

    Include technical material that would disrupt the flow of the thesis.
    Included for curious or disbelieving readers
