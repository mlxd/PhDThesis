%\chapter*{Introduction}  % Name of the unnumbered section

This body of work was carried out during my time as a Ph.D student at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). The purpose of the work described herein was to understand the dynamics of rapidly rotating Bose--Einstein condensates subjected to perturbations. While it is possible derive some analytical solutions to rapidly rotating condensate behaviour (LLL), such solutions are rare. This thesis concentrates on the numerical solutions of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, and the resulting dynamics of those solutions.

This work is motivated by the use of Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) systems as model tools to investigate turbulent and chaotic quantum behaviour. Ideally, these systems can also be used for long-term memory storage for quantum computing systems. Finally, these type of systems allow the study of quantum mechanical effects on mesoscopic scales, making them a great tool for simulating condensed matter physics. Given these statements, being able to manipulate and engineer specific states, and thus behaviour, from BECs requires tools to allow this. I investigate the use of kicked optical potentials and direct phase engineering of the wavefunction and examine their usefulness for generating such behaviour.

To do this we assume a trial system of a BEC rapidly rotating to generate a large number of vortices, arranged in a triangular pattern pattern. The trial wavefunction is subjected to the different manipulations listed earlier, and I examine the resulting dynamics. A large numerical component will be required to perform such simulations, and so I will also discuss the development of numerical tools using graphics processing units (GPU) for these studies, with comparisons drawn against standard simulation techniques.

The thesis will be outlined as follows:

\section{Chapter 1}
The field of cold-atomic gas systems will be introduced, and the theory of Bose--Einstein condensation discussed. The field will be thoroughly examined and discussed via a literature review, examining theory, experimentation, origins and also future of the field. Emphasis will be placed on material and works relevant to the study performed herein.

\section{Chapter 2}
    Here I examine the use of methods for describing the Bose--Einstein condensate numerically. I introduce the necessary algorithms and considerations to simulate such a system. General purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing will be introduced here, with the implementation of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation discussed. Calculation of the Bogoloiubov spectrum, and its implementation is discussed here also.

Background / Related Work (~8-20 pages)
    More than a literature review
    Organize related work - impose structure
    Be clear as to how previous work being described relates to your own.
    The reader should not be left wondering why you've described something!!
    Critique the existing work - Where is it strong where is it weak? What are the unreasonable/undesirable assumptions?
    Identify opportunities for more research (i.e., your thesis) Are there unaddressed, or more important related topics?
    After reading this chapter, one should understand the motivation for and importance of your thesis
    You should clearly and precisely define all of the key concepts dealt with in the rest of the thesis, and teach the reader what s/he needs to know to understand the rest of the thesis.

Results and Evaluation (~15-30 pages)

    adequacy, efficiency, productiveness, effectiveness (choose your criteria, state them clearly and justify them)
    be careful that you are using a fair measure, and that you are actually measuring what you claim to be measuring
    if comparing with previous techniques those techniques must be described in Chapter 2
    be honest in evaluation
    admit weaknesses
