\section{Few vortex states}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:superfluid}, the discovery and manipulation of quantum vortices remains an active area of research.



Given that the energy of a vortex-carrying condensate scales as $E\propto l^2$, as $L_z \propto l$, any increase in the angular momentum causes a squared increase in the energy. Thus, for energetic favorability, the system prefers to maintain singly-charged vortices. To generate a vortex in the condensate costs energy,
