\section{Introduction}

\iffalse
%The use of delta-kicked Hamiltonians are common in the study of chaotic systems \cite{CT:Ullah_epjd_2012,CT:White_njp_2014}. The delta-kicked rotor is a prime example of such a system that exhibits chaotic motion following a series of successive kicks. Another such model, building upon the kicked rotor, is the kicked harmonic oscillator, wherein the Hamiltonian acquires an additional quadratic potential. The behaviour of such systems have been well studied \cite{CT:Berman_nonlin_1991, CT:Duffy_pra_2004}, and are interesting models to examine the onset of chaos in both classical and quantum mechanical systems. By converting the conjugate variables to quantum operators, the quantum mechanical analogues can be examined. Granted, chaos in the quantum mechanical world differs from that of the classical world (e.g. quantum unitary evolution), insights may be gained from the study of systems on the boundary between the quantum and classical world.

%Here I propose such a system, given a rapidly Bose-Einstein condensate featuring a well ordered vortex lattice. The goal is to generate chaotic motion of the vortices in the condensate through kicking with an optical lattice having a period given by the rotation and translational symmetry of the vortex lattice. Since it is known that the vortex lattice is an Abrikosov lattice with 6-fold symmetry, one can say that given a rotation frequency of $\Omega$, the lattice will return to the same orientation after a rotation of $\Omega/6$. Thus, I can kick the system at this interval with a stationary optical lattice potential, without the need to rotate with the system, making this more experimentally realistic. While the expected dynamics of vortices were not observed in the proposed system, additional interesting behaviour was seen. Thus, I will continue to discuss the model of the system, and the observed dynamical behaviour will be described.

As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:vortlatt}, the use of optical lattice potentials is ubiquitous in the field of ultracold atoms. Given their perfect periodic structure, it is interesting to examine the effect these lattices have on already periodic structures. For a rapidly rotating condensate, the density will feature a large periodic Abrikosov lattice having $6$-fold triangular symmetry. The use of optical lattices on vortex lattices has been shown to allow for pinning of the vortex cores to the lattice maxima \cite{OL:Reijnders_prl_2004,Vtx:Tung_prl_2006}. Assuming blue detuned laser fields, the lattice maxima will drive atoms away, and make it favourable for vortex cores to sit in these positions. The observation of a transition between lattice geometries can be observed in these cases. This is, however, experimentally challenging as the optical lattice must rotate with the vortex lattice. This will require a full rotating optical lattice, which is to be matched to the rotation rate of the lattice. The creation of a rotating quasi two-dimensional optical lattice has been carried out in~\cite{Vtx:Tung_prl_2006}, where the authors have used a rotating mask with the hole placement to allow for the required optical diffraction patterns. However, the authors discuss some of the difficulties arising from the inclusion of a mechanically rotating stage, as well as the heating effects arising from the presence of the always-on optical lattice. As the vortex lattice has 6-fold rotational symmetry, after rotating by
$\Omega_{k}=6\Omega=2\pi\times 6$ Hz the system has returned to its initial orientation. In this situation the need for a rotating optical potential can be replaced by a periodically flashed optical lattice. Here, I will investigate the effect of the single application of an optical lattice to the vortex lattice.

 For short application times, the potential will kick the wavefunction, and can be seen as leaving a phase imprint with minimal immediate density change. From Sec.~\ref{ss:pert_opt_latt} the effect of the kick can then be observed in the ensuing dynamics. Interestingly, one can observe the appearance of moir\'e interference patterns in the condensate density, while the positions of the vortex cores are only minimally affected. I will begin by discussing the model, and present the explanation of the resulting interference pattern. I show that it stems from the interference between the different $\mathbf{k}$-vectors, with signatures of the effect visible in the condensate's kinetic energy spectrum. Finally, I will discuss the uses of this effect as a microscope for observing the presence of vortex lattices without time-of-flight.

In this work I assume the standard formalism of a single component Bose--Einstein condensate in a radially symmetric trap of frequency $\omega_\perp$. By tightly confining the condensate along the $z$-dimension, with trapping frequency $\omega_z$, such that $\omega_z \gg \omega_\perp$, the condensate enters a pancake-shaped geometry. As the energy required to excite any higher modes along $z$ is $\geq \hbar\omega_z$, one can assume all excitations are planar along the radial coordinate $x-y$ axes, with the $z$ axis in the harmonic oscillator ground state. Modelling of this system is performed in the mean-field limit, given by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, with Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gpe_h0}
	H_{\mathrm{GP}} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\omega_{\perp}^2\mathbf{r}^2 + g\vert\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\vert^2.
\end{equation}

Here $g$ describes the interaction between atoms in the condensate, given by \begin{equation}
g = \frac{4\pi\hbar^2a_s}{m},
\end{equation}
where $a_s$ is the s-wave scattering length of the atomic species. Restricting the system to a two-dimensional geometry also requires the move to an effective interaction which encompasses the net effect of the $z$-dimension. This is enabled by scaling the interaction by the length of the harmonic oscillator along the $z$-dimension, and becomes \cite[pg. 456]{BK:Pethick_smith_}
\begin{equation}
g_{2D} = g\sqrt{\frac{m\omega_\perp}{2\pi\hbar}}.
\end{equation}

To generate vortices in the condensate angular momentum must be added to the system. Experimentally, this can be achieved by various techniques, such as stirring the condensate with a blue-detuned beam \cite{Vtx:Raman_prl_2001}, by carefully inverting the trap bias field potential \cite{Vtx:Kawaguchi_pra_2004}[Nakahara Phys. Rev. A 93, 013626], or through use of artificial gauge fields \cite{AO:Dalibard_rmp_2011}, to name but a few. To theoretically describe the system we enter the co-rotating, which is done by adding the angular momentum operator to the Hamiltonian. The time dependent dynamics of the system can be analysed using the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gpe2d}
	i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[ H_{\text{GP}}  -  \Omega_z L_z \right] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t),
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the angular frequency and $L_z = xp_y - yp_x$ is the angular momentum operator about the $z$-axis. This is the form of \eqref{eqn:gpe} for a two-dimensional harmonically trapped condensate. If the angular rotation frequency approaches the condensate trapping frequency, $\Omega_z \approx \omega_\perp$ the condensate gains a large triangular lattice of vortices.  The effect of setting $\Omega=\omega_\perp$, can be partially understood in a mean field setting by rewriting the Hamiltonian in the form
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar\partial_t \Psi =
    \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(i\nabla - m\Omega\times\mathbf{r})^2 + \frac{m}{2}(\omega_\perp - \Omega)^2 + g_{2d}|\Psi|^2 \right)\Psi.
\end{equation}
The above Hamiltonian rises from the equivalence between a rotating condensate and that of a charged particle in a magnetic field. One can see that were the rotation and trapping frequencies equal, the condensate would no longer see a confining potential, due to the centrifugal forces experienced, resulting in an untrapped system.

As I am interested in lattice ordering effects, I assume that the trapping frequency along the $z$-axis, $\omega_z$, is much larger than the one along the transverse axis, $\omega_\perp$. This allows the condensate to be modelled as a quasi-2d pancake-shaped geometry, and is a valid assumption for realistic condensates~\cite{BEC:Fetter_revmodphys_2009}. Neglecting the $z$ dimension ($\textbf{r}\equiv [x,y]$) simplifies the analysis of the system and resulting dynamics. For this work Eq.~\eqref{eqn:gpe2d} will be numerically solved, using the pseudospectral Fourier split operator method making use of GPU computing\cite{NUMERICS}. For realistic experimental parameters I assumed  $N=9.8\times 10^5$ atoms of $^{87}$Rb, with an s-wave scattering length of $a_s=4.76\times10^{-9}$ m~\cite{AO:Roberts_prl_1998}. The numerically evaluated ground-state for the given set of parameters is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vlatt_gnd}, and it can be

For the chosen parameters, the number of vortices within the visible density region is approximately 600, giving a filling factor of $\nu \approx 800 $. This places the system within the mean-field quantum Hall regime, and therefore a description using Gross--Pitaevskii theory is adequate~\cite{Vtx:Schweikhard_prl_2004}.

As already discussed in detail above, given the large number of vortices in the condensate density, as well as the lowered density resulting from large centrifugal forces, the vortex cores become large and form a highly periodic triangular lattice. The non-orthogonal lattice vectors are given in position space by $\mathbf{a}_1 = a_v[1,0]$ and $\mathbf{a}_2 = a_v[-1/2, \sqrt{3}/2]$, where $a_v$ is the distance between vortex cores. The lattice ``constant'' is truly only constant in areas of near uniform density. Thus, due to the inhomogeneous wavefunction density, the vortices near the edges are separated by a much greater distance than those at the centre. For the analysis I have therefore chosen to ignore all vortices near the condensate edge. The momentum space ($\mathbf{k}$-space) lattice vectors are reciprocal to the given $\mathbf{r}$-space vectors, and given by $\mathbf{b}_1 = 4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_v)[\sqrt{3}/2,1/2]$ and $\mathbf{b}_2 = (4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_v))[0,1]$.

\section{Model}

Using an optical potential one can create a perturbation in the condensate density by switching it on for a brief period of time. Such a {\it kick} must occur only for a time much shorter than the rotation period of the vortex lattice, of angular rotation frequency $\Omega = 0.995\omega_\perp$, so that the effect is limited to a phase imprinting and not to a direct change in the density distribution. For the work carried out herein, the duration of the kick is $\tau_{\text{kick}}=10^{-5}$~s, which is fast compared to the classical rotation period of the 6-fold symmetric lattice of $T_{6} \approx 166 $ ms. This ensured that the vortex lattice was essentially stationary during the kick. To examine the effect that periodicity plays on the system, the optical potential was chosen to match the geometry of the Abrikosov vortex lattice, with the angle of relative alignment $\theta_\Delta$ given as a free parameter. The optical potential was modeled as the sum of counter-propagating laser beams, as
\begin{equation}
    V_{\text{opt}} = V_0\displaystyle\sum_{j}\cos^2 \left[ \textbf{k}_{j}\cdot\textbf{r} \right],
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is the optical lattice potential amplitude, and $j=\lbrace 0,1,2,\ldots \rbrace$ is the index of each respective laser with a differing $\mathbf{k}$-space wave-vector. By careful choice of the wave-vectors $\textbf{k}_{j}$ the density modulation given by the vortices is matched to the optical potential. This is achieved using the reciprocal lattice vectors defined by the vortex lattice, $\mathbf{b}_{1,2}$, and an additional third wave-vector, $\mathbf{k}_3 = 4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_o)\{\sqrt{3}/2,-1/2\}$. For the resulting optical potential, I define the lattice sites as the maxima of intensity. These, which are in turn matched with the condensate density minima of the vortex lattice.


As the vortex lattice constant in a rapidly rotating atomic BEC is large, optical lattices with wavelengths on the order of tens of microns are necessary \cite{BEC:Fallani_optexp_2005, AO:Williams_optexp_2008}. By ensuring a short kick with an amplitude on the order of $10^{-2} \mu $, with $\mu$ as the BEC's chemical potential, the result of the kick is an imprinted phase on the wavefunction \cite{Vtx:Dobrek_pra_1999}. As an example, following a single kick the vortex lattice phase can be observed to be modified, with localised phase gradients at the optical lattice maxima, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Phase_diff_after_kick}. These localised gradients lead to the development of a flow originating from each optical lattice potential maxima location, and in turn create well-defined interference patterns resulting from phonons created by the kick. In the presence of a vortex lattice with a periodic core arrangement, this creates moir\'e superlattice structures \cite{SS:Murata_acsn_2010} in the density of the condensate. Although this type of pattern has been observed in many solid-state systems, such as graphene on hexagonal boron nitride~\cite{SS:Yankowitz_natphys_2012}, they are static in such cases. In this system, the structures are dynamical, and revive at well defined intervals.

\iffalse
To study these resulting structures, I have performed a spectral decomposition of the kinetic energy of the condesate~\cite{CT:Nore_prl_1997,CT:Nore_pof_1997,CT:Bradley_prx_2012}. For this the wavefunction is first written in amplitude (density) $\rho(\mathbf{r},t)$ and phase $S(\mathbf{r},t)$ form via a Madelung transform as given by \eqref{eqn:madelung}.
\iffalse
as
$
		\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)}\exp{\left[\mathrm{i}S(\mathbf{r},t)\right]}.
$
\fi
Making use of the Gross--Pitaevskii energy functional \eqref{eqn:gpe_functional}, and substituting in the above form gives
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{kqp}} = \int d\mathbf{r} \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}| \nabla\sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)} |^2  + \frac{m}{2}|\sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r},t) |^2\right).
\end{equation}
One can decompose this into the quantum pressure (first) and kinetic energy (second) terms. The kinetic energy term can seen as a density-weighted velocity field, $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t) = \sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r},t)$. This can be further decomposed into the sum of compressible and incompressible terms,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kin_en}
    \mathbf{u(r},t) = \mathbf{u}^c(\mathbf{r},t) + \mathbf{u}^i(\mathbf{r},t),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}^c, \mathbf{u}^i$ are the compressible and incompressible terms respectively. This can be solved for both terms by performing a Helmholtz decomposition on the resulting field separating terms that are longitudinal ($\mathbf{u}^c$) and transverse ($\mathbf{u}^i$) with
\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:kinterms}
\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{u}^c(\mathbf{r},t) = 0, \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^i(\mathbf{r},t) = 0.\\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
By introducing the vector potential, $\mathbf{A}$, and scalar potential, $B$, such that
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{u}^c = \nabla B, \\
    \mathbf{u}^i = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
we can rewrite Eq.~\eqref{eqn:kin_en} as
\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t) = -\nabla^2 \mathbf{A}, \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t) = \nabla^2 {B}. \\
\end{align}

To solve the above equation I begin by solving for $B$ by performing a spectral decomposition as
\begin{equation}
    B = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j} \frac{k_j}{|\mathbf{k}|^2}\mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}],
\end{equation}
where $k_j$ is the $j$-th component in $\mathbf{k}$ space, and $\mathscr{F}$ is the Fourier transform. The resulting solution for $\mathbf{u}^c$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}_i^c] = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j} \frac{k_i k_j}{|\mathbf{k}|^2} \mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}],
\end{equation}
which after taking note of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:kin_en} gives
\begin{align}
    \mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}_i^i] &= \mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}_i] - \mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}_i^c]. \\
    &= \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j}\left(\delta_{i,j} - \frac{k_ik_j}{|\mathbf{k}|^2}\right)\mathscr{F}[\mathbf{u}_i].
\end{align}

This decomposition separates the energy contribution from phonons and vortex cores, represented by compressible and incompressible terms respectively~\cite{CT:Horng_pra_2009}. By averaging over binned shells in $\mathbf{k}$-space, the kinetic energy spectra, $E^{c,i}(k)$, are calculated as~\cite{CT:Bradley_prx_2012}
\begin{equation}
	E^{c,i}(k) = \frac{mk}{2}\sum\limits_{j\in\mathbf{r}} \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi_k \frac{ |\mathcal{U}_j^{c,i}(\mathbf{k},t) |^2}{s_k},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{U}_j^{c,i}(\mathbf{k},t) = \int d^2 \mathbf{r} e^{-i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})} u_j^{c,i}(\mathbf{r},t).
\end{equation}
The terms $u_j^{c,i}(\mathbf{r},t)$ represent the position-space density-weighted velocity components in the specified shell, where $\phi_k$ is the polar angle, and $s_k$ is the number of values in the chosen shell.
\fi

For state-of-the-art analysis of condensates, one of the most widely used methods to understand the kinetic energy is to perform a spectral decomposition via the method explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:kinspec}. This is a widely used method to separate the contributions from vortices and phonons in the kinetic energy, and is analogous to methods used in classical fluid systems. For vortices in both liquid helium and Bose--Einstein condensates this decomposition allows one to characterise the onset of quantum turbulence, and is used extensively in the literature \cite{VTX:Kobayashi_prl_2005,VTX:Tsubota_jphys_2009,CT:Bradley_prx_2012,VTX:White_jphys_2014,VTX:Skaugen_pre_2016}, to mention but a few. In these instances, comparisons are made between the resulting incompressible (vortex) kinetic energy terms and the classical turbulence Kolmogorov kinetic energy scaling law \cite{BK:Frisch_1995} $E(k) \propto k^{-5/3}$ for three-dimensional systems, or with an additional scaling region of $k^{-3}$ in two-dimensions. Experimental verification of this scaling law has been examined through numerical recreation of the experimental conditions, and has shown good agreement with the theory \cite{VTX:Neely_prl_2013}.

However, Reeves {\it et} al. \cite{VTX:Reeves_pra_2014} have discussed how the given kinetic energy spectral decomposition does not truly represent the kinetic energy of the system, as the spectral terms are not additive in $k$-space. The classical interpretation is described as being ``\textit{obtained by applying the general correspondence between a two-point correlation function and its associated
power spectrum to the velocity field}'', as stated by the authors. They propose a quantum version of the above description, which involves including the condensate phase, alongside the density weighted velocity field, as $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t) = \sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{r},t)\exp\left(\textrm{i}S(\mathbf{r},t)\right)$. The resulting kinetic spectra may now accurately describe the true spectrum of the condensate. For an examination of the vortex lattice, it is instructive to investigate the effectiveness of both approaches. For the vortex lattice system as described previously, an example of the kinetic energy spectra are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:ek_clvqu} for both the classical (left) and quantum (right) methods. The resulting magnitudes of the compressible (middle) and incompressible (bottom) energies are given here also. For the classical spectrum, the appearance of highly periodic structures are observed and appear at wavenumbers corresponding with lattice spacings, which is not present in the quantum spectrum. The resulting magnitudes are, however, more representative of what one might expect for a quantum system, with the compressible kinetic energy zero at the cores, and the incompressible zero everywhere else. While the quantum version may more accurately represent the true kinetic energy of the condensate system, the periodic structure observed in the classical spectra are lost. As the periodicity is an important characteristic of the vortex lattice, the use of the classical kinetic energy spectral decomposition gives more information useful to this work, and will be used in the following sections.

\section{Delta-kick dynamics}\label{sec:kickvl}
\subsection{Non-rotating condensate}
To fully characterise the effect kicking has on a rapidly rotating BEC carrying a vortex lattice it is instructive to understand the dynamics following a kick in the absence of a vortex lattice. For an accurate comparison, the trapping frequency of the non-rotating condensate is adjusted such that the background densities match that of the rotating condensate. This is achieved by assuming the centrifugal term competing against the harmonic oscillator frequency as $V_{\text{opt}} = 1/2m(\omega^2_\perp - \Omega^2)\mathbf
{r}^2$, where $\Omega=0.995\omega_\perp$ is the value chosen for the rapidly rotating case, as given by Eq.~\eqref{eqn:vector_potential_gpe}.

For a stationary (non-kicked) condensate the kinetic energy spectrum will remain constant during time-evolution, with a kick leading to the appearance of new, time varying components. To observe this I numerically evolve the system by setting $V(\mathbf{r},t) = V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + V_{\text{opt}}(\mathbf{r},t)$, where the time dependent optical potential is only active for $\tau=10^{-5}$~s of the simulation time. As discussed earlier, this short kicking duration is sufficient to allow a phase imprint onto the condensate wavefunction, without any change in the density on the timescales of the kick itself. Next, I examine the compressible and incompressible kinetic energy spectrum following the kick (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ekc_eki_novtx}). Unsurprisingly, the spectrum is dominated by a peak corresponding to the wave-number associated with the optical potential at $k=4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_o)$ (indicated by the dashed line), and several smaller ones corresponding to higher harmonics of $n$-th next nearest neighbour components of the lattice. This makes sense as the nearest neighbour lattice spacings should be the dominant structure with higher order spacings dropping in intensity due to the finite system size. As no rotation is added by the imparted phonon modes, the incompressible energy is an order of magnitude smaller compared to the compressible energy. Although the incompressible energy should technically be zero for a condensate with no vortices, given the difference in magnitudes this can be taken as a numerical issue, and can be assumed as zero. Following from this I will restrict the analysis to the compressible part of the spectrum.

\begin{figure}

A peak at $k=4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a_o)$ can be seen, which corresponds to the lattice spacing, $a_o$ (indicated by the dashed line), and the smaller, higher energy peaks can be attributed to higher harmonics between nearest and next-nearest neighbours. The incompressible spectrum is much smaller than the compressible spectrum, and thus is neglected for all further analysis.}
    \label{fig:ekc_eki_novtx}
\end{figure}


The evolution of the nearest neighbour peak in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum during the first 250 ms after the kick is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:novtx_p5k}(a). It initially oscillates in and out of existence and eventually disperses over a wide range of wave-numbers. Snapshots of the density evolution are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:novtx_p5k}(b), which clearly show that the oscillations correspond to the existence of a transient lattice pattern with several revivals, having the same underlying structure as the optical potential. In fact, the lattice pattern is best formed whenever the main peak in the kinetic energy spectrum goes to zero, i.e.~when the imprinted kinetic energy has been converted into density modulations. The period of the oscillations can be related to the speed of sound divided by the lattice constant and therefore the appearance of the lattice can be attributed to phonon interference.

\subsection{Rapidly rotating condensate}

    Kicking a condensate carrying an Abrikosov vortex lattice with the above optical lattice gives an additional parameter, $\theta_\Delta$, which describes the orientation of the imprinted phonon lattice angle relative to the vortex lattice. For simplicity, it is assumed that the vortex and optical potential lattices have the same lattice constant, $a_v=a_o=a$ (see below for a discussion of the incommensurate case), which means that symmetry allows for a restriction of the angle to $\theta_\Delta\in[0,\pi/3]$. In the following it can be seen that adjusting $\theta_\Delta$ leads to the appearance of different, transient super-structures in the condensate density.

    If $\theta_\Delta=0$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_density}(a)) the kicking imparts kinetic energy at wave-numbers that are already well defined in the lattice. No significant change to the compressible kinetic energy spectrum is observed in this case, apart from small amplitude modulations on the well defined peaks.

	\begin{figure}
        \centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{ch5_kickit/fig4}
			\caption[Effect of kicking on condensate with a large vortex lattice.]{Condensate density at $t=1.4\times10^{-2}$ s for several optical lattice rotation angles. The cell size of the super-lattice structures can be seen to shrink as the angle is increased. The angles for the examples shown are $(a)~\theta_\Delta=0$, $(b)~\theta_\Delta=2\pi/45$, $(c)~\theta_\Delta=4\pi/45$, $(d)~\theta_\Delta=2\pi/15$. }
			\label{fig:moire_density}
		\end{figure}

    However, if the angle between both lattices is finite, and not an integer multiple of $\pi/3$, superlattice structures appear after a short time (see Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_density}(b)-(d)), which have a structure cell size that decreases for increasing values of $\theta_\Delta\in[0,\pi/6]$ and beyond which increases for larger values until the misalignment angle reaches the lattice symmetry point again at $\theta_\Delta=\pi/3$. These structures are transient, and several revivals can be observed before the condensate settles back into the vortex lattice structure with an increase in the background wave-number spread, as expected based on kicking the non-rotating condensate. An example of this for a fixed angle is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dtheta20_ev}.

    To explain the interference patterns observed for misaligning the optical and the vortex lattice, I employ moir\'e interference theory \cite{SS:Hermann_jpcm_2012}. Moir\'e patterns are known to appear when two periodic structures are overlaid while slightly misaligned to each other, and can be calculated from the reciprocal lattice vectors. In all generality, any choice of equidistantly separated reciprocal lattice vectors can be parameterised as
    	\begin{equation}
    		\mathbf{g}_{l} = g_0 \left[ \sin\left( \frac{2\pi l}{\upsilon}+\theta \right),\, \cos\left( \frac{2\pi l}{\upsilon} +\theta\right) \right],
    	\end{equation}
    where $\upsilon$ describes the rotational symmetry of the lattice, $l$ labels the vector direction on the unit circle, $\theta$ is the angle with respect to a chosen coordinate system and $g_0$ is the reciprocal lattice constant. For commensurate and triangular lattices we get $g_0=4\pi/(\sqrt{3}a)$, $\upsilon=6$ and the vector directions are $l=\left[0\dots\upsilon-1\right]$. As only the relative mis-alignement between the vortex and the phonon lattice matters, I choose $\theta=0$ for the vortex lattice and $\theta=\theta_\Delta$ for the optical potential alignment.
    All possible wavelengths that can appear in an interference pattern between two such lattices in real space are then given by
    	\begin{equation}
    		\lambda_{ll'} = \frac{\lambda_0}{|\mathbf{\mathbf{g}_{ll'}|}},
    		\label{eq:InterferenceVectors}
    	\end{equation}
    where
    $\mathbf{g}_{ll'}=\mathbf{g}_{l}^{\text{V}}-\mathbf{g}_{l'}^{\text{P}}$, and
    $\lambda_0 = 4\pi/\sqrt{3}$ for the commensurate triangular lattices. Figure~\ref{fig:moire_higher} demonstrates the resulting interferences between wavevectors in both position and momentum space. One can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:dtheta20_ev} for $\theta_\Delta = \pi/9$ that a pattern matching the longest wavelength, $\lambda_M= \max[\lambda_{ll'}] \approx 2.9 a$, appears around $t=24$~ms and is clearly the most visible one for the given angle. Shorter wavelengths are hard to discern in this system, and therefore I will concentrate on the lowest wave-number in the following.

In $\mathbf{k}$-space the shortest $|\mathbf{g}_{ll^\prime}|$ corresponds to adjacent wave-vectors with the smallest $\theta_\Delta$ between them (see inset in Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_lambda_1}). Due to the symmetry of the lattices the most visible structures are therefore given by $\lambda_M=\lambda_{00}$ for $\theta_\Delta\in[0,\pi/6]$ and $\lambda_M=\lambda_{01}$ for $\theta_\Delta\in[\pi/6,\pi/3]$ (see inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_lambda_1}).
While this symmetry assumption no longer holds strictly true after the system has been kicked, it is still fulfilled to a very good approximation during the initial dynamics. One can then obtain the wavelength of the dominating moir\'e structure as~\cite{BIO:Blair_jneur_2007,SS:Yankowitz_natphys_2012}
    	\begin{equation}
    		\lambda_M = \frac{a}{2\sin(\eta/2)},
    		\label{eqn:moire_size}
    	\end{equation}
    where $\eta=\min\{\theta_\Delta,\frac{\pi}{3} - \theta_\Delta \} $  (see Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_lambda_1}).
These super-structures become observable when the wavelength becomes smaller than the radius of the condensate, which for the chosen parameters is $\lambda_M \approx 11a$ and which corresponds to an angle $\theta_\Delta \approx \pi/36$.
One can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:moire_lambda_1} that once the relative angle is increased beyond this value the structure sizes shrink to a minimum value at the point of complete misalignment, $\theta_\Delta=\pi/6$, giving $\lambda_M\approx 1.93\,a$, and increase again up to the point of symmetry. Beyond this point the behaviour starts over, due to the symmetry of the lattice. Note that in principle the above procedure can be carried out for square or other optical lattice geometries.

\end{figure}

    The appearance of the moir\'e vector in $\mathbf{k}$-space can be confirmed from the numerical simulations by looking at the compressible kinetic energy spectra which is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:dtheta_kspec}. Apart from the dominant peaks corresponding to the underlying triangular geometry of the Abrikosov lattice, which are independent of $\theta_\Delta$ (straight lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:dtheta_kspec}), a number of additional peaks appear. Their position is a function of the misalignment angle and the lowest wave-number that appears increases its value with increasing $\theta_\Delta$. This is consistent with the moir\'e model and the appearance of density structures of differing size. Furthermore, a symmetric repeat of this structure about the $\theta_\Delta=\pi/6$ point is also visible, which corresponds to the $\pi/3 - \theta_\Delta$ lattice vector component. The minimum wavelength observed agrees with the theoretically determined minimum value of $\lambda_M\approx 1.93\,a$ and all other values over the range of observed angles. Note that for the higher harmonics at larger wave-numbers similar behaviour exists and is also covered by the moir\'e model.

    Figure~\ref{fig:dtheta_kspec_backg} shows the compressible kinetic energy spectrum from \ref{fig:dtheta20_ev} with the data from the background lattice to enhance the visibility of the high wavenumber terms. It should be noted that given sufficient time the higher order wave-numbers can influence the density dynamics, but the system remains dominated by the lowest wave-number. Due to coupling between adjacent modes in the system, all interference patterns tend to become hard to discern after some time. As the condensate system is finite-sized a refocussing of the interference structures will eventually take place. However, the time-scales necessary to examine this were not investigated.

    %It is expected (but not investigated) that in the long time limit the interference patterns will eventually refocus and reappear. While the newly generated moir\'e interference patterns can also in turn create additional interferences with the background lattices, I will choose to ignore this effect for the reasons mentioned above regarding higher order wavenumbers.

    In the following I will briefly discuss what happens for stronger kicking, or when the two lattices are non-commensurate. In the above the strength of the kicking pulse was chosen such that its perturbation only leads to a phase imprinting \cite{Vtx:Dobrek_pra_1999,BEC:Denschlag_science_2000}, with minimal change to the initial density. If one increases the kicking intensity the situation becomes quite different and one can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:kickp20k}$(a)$ that higher order wave-numbers become more strongly excited. This, in turn, leads to modulations of the condensate density at shorter wavelength and an example is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:kickp20k}$(b)$-$(e)$, with the numerically calculated averaged spectra given in Fig.~\ref{fig:kick_compare_spec}. However, as for fully realistic experimental situations it is necessary to consider the heating of the condensates due to the disturbance once the kicking becomes stronger, I restrict this investigation to low intensity pulses.

	\caption[Higher order modes induced by stronger kicking.]{(a) For a kicking strength of $V_0 = 5.4\times10^{-2}\mu$ for a non-rotating condensate higher order modes become non-negligible contributors to the compressible kinetic energy spectrum. This leads to the appearance of higher-order peaks which are visible in the condensate density. Close-ups of the density structures are shown for (b) 24 ms, (c) 36 ms, (d) 56 ms, and (e) 88 ms. Note that the larger structures in these plots are given by the optical lattice constant, $a_o$, which is set to the mean inter-vortex distance for the rapidly rotating condensate. In the presence of vortices this is anticipated to create many additional interferences.}

\end{figure}

    A situation where the optical and the vortex lattice have different lattice constants can be imagined to appear naturally due to experimental uncertainties. Defining $a_o = a_v(1+\epsilon)$ the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:InterferenceVectors} can be calculated to be
    \begin{equation}
    	\lambda_M = \frac{a_v(1+\epsilon)}{\sqrt{2(1+\epsilon)(1-\cos\theta) + \epsilon^2}}
    	\label{eqn:moire_size_eps}
    \end{equation}
    which reduces to Eq.~\eqref{eqn:moire_size} for $\epsilon=0$. Evaluating this expression for $\epsilon = (-0.1,0,0.1)$ as given by Fig.~\ref{fig:epsilon} shows that the largest moir\'e wavelength changes slightly for small values of $\epsilon$, but it remains distinct enough from the higher order wavelengths to stay visible in the evolution. This ensures that the system examined here is experimentally realistic.

    For large deviations of the lattice constant, the assumption of the largest moir\'e wavevector playing the dominant role is no longer valid, as many wavevectors approach comparable scales, which will require an examination of several resulting wavevectors.

\section{Vortex dynamics following a kick}
While I have concentrated mostly on the phonon modes of the condensate density it is necessary to also examine the result of kicking on the vortex lattice. Fig.~\ref{fig:kickit_traj} shows the densities and trajectories in the co-rotating frame for a kick of $\theta_{\Delta}=\pi (1/60, 1/10)$. Some deviation from solid-body rotation is observed at the edge of the examined vortex region, but the central vortex regions show almost no variation from their ideal lattice positions.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch5_kickit/Trajectory_after_kick_theta0_15_3offset}
	\caption[Vortex densities and trajectories following a kick.]{The condensate densities are shown for times $t=(20,200)$ ms, and for $\theta_\Delta = ( 3^{\textrm{o}},18^{\textrm{o}})$ (top and bottom). The resulting trajectories of the vortices show minimal deviation from their initial lattice positions over 2 seconds of time evolution.}\label{fig:kickit_traj}
\end{figure}

Both cases demonstrate the same overall dynamics, with the vortex lattice showing extreme robustness against the phononic perturbances that build following a kick. The moir\'e superlattice forms on top of the existing condensate density.

\section{Conclusions and outlook}\label{sec:ch5_conc}
The purpose of the previous work was to investigate the effect of a kicked optical lattice potential with a well defined periodicity on a vortex lattice having its own periodic structure. As observed in the incompressible spectrum, kicking gave negligible effect to the vortex positions, with the lattice remaining well defined with near constant spacings, even in the long time limit. The optical lattice kicks solely modified the background density around the vortex cores. One could observe that the vortex lattice remains incredibly stable and strongly resilient to perturbations and modulations in density. Given the stability of the lattice, it can be expected that even for a finite number of kicks, the lattice will remain mostly unbroken. It can also be expected that heating effects would play a role in destabilising the condensate, and to determine any long-term realistic behavior from this system, including the treatment of a non-negligible thermal cloud contribution would be necessary.

The kinetic energy spectra provided a useful tool to investigate the order of the imparted wavenumbers following a kick, and were very closely matched with the results from moir\'e interference theory. The existence of this moir\'e interference effect has some nice consequences. It can, for example, be thought of as a tool to test the periodicity of a structure that is too small to resolve without time of flight. In general, this technique may be used on other types of periodic structures, for example crossed solitons in 2D condensates \cite{Tadhg_soliton}. As optical lattices can offer a large number of free parameters (lattice constant, amplitude, misalignment, geometry, \ldots), a full toolbox can be developed for this technique.
%As an extension of work on large Abrikosov lattices, some preliminary work in zig-zag and linear vortex crystals, in conjunction with A.~Barahmi and Th.~Busch, showed that without well defined periodic behaviour there is negligible observation of any peaks in the compressible energy spectrum. As such, there were no discernible moir\'e patterns in the density. It is expected that for such an effect to be useful highly periodic systems are required, with well defined wave-vectors. It remains an open question as to whether this can be used in a realistic experimental setting for such a purpose.

While the system discussed in this chapter was originally proposed to investigate delta-kicked chaotic dynamics, it became clear very quickly that the robustness of the vortex lattice with respect to realistic kicking strengths did not allow for significant vortex dynamics. Nevertheless, an investigation into periodic kicking is still an interesting (and numerically even more challenging) endeavor. As vortex lattices feature a well-defined rotation rate and 6-fold symmetry, every $\pi/3$ allows the system to rotate to a symmetric position. Providing a periodic kick at this rate, would then allow to circumvent the problem of the solid-body rotation of the vortex lattice. This would allow the lattice to always have the same alignment angle, at least for a number of kick repetitions.
