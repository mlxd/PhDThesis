	Abstract = {Experiments on the axial breathing mode in a rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensate are examined. Assuming a cold cloud without thermal component, we show that errors due to defocus of an imaging camera in addition to an inclination of the rotational axis can lead to a significant underestimate of the rotation rate in the fast rotation limit; within these uncertainties, our theoretical prediction agrees with the experimental data. We also show that, in the fast rotation regime, the Thomas-Fermi theory, which is inapplicable there, underestimates the rotation rate. Underestimation of the rotation rate due to these effects would also partly explain a discrepancy between theory and experiment for the Tkachenko mode frequency in the fast rotation regime.},

@article{BEC:Billam_pra_2013,
	Abstract = {While the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is well established as the canonical dynamical description of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at zero temperature, describing the dynamics of BECs at finite temperatures remains a difficult theoretical problem, particularly when considering low-temperature, nonequilibrium systems in which depletion of the condensate occurs dynamically as a result of external driving. In this paper, we describe a fully time-dependent numerical implementation of a second-order, number-conserving description of finite-temperature BEC dynamics. This description consists of equations of motion describing the coupled dynamics of the condensate and noncondensate fractions in a self-consistent manner, and is ideally suited for the study of low-temperature, nonequilibrium, driven systems. The delta-kicked-rotor BEC provides a prototypical example of such a system, and we demonstrate the efficacy of our numerical implementation by investigating its dynamics at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the qualitative features of the system dynamics at zero temperature are generally preserved at finite temperatures, and predict a quantitative finite-temperature shift of resonance frequencies which would be relevant for, and could be verified by, future experiments.

@article{BEC:Watanabe_entropy_2016,
	Abstract = {The system of a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice is governed by two factors: nonlinearity originating from the interparticle interaction, and the periodicity of the system set by the lattice. The high level of controllability associated with such an arrangement allows for the study of the competition and interplay between these two, and gives rise to a whole range of interesting and rich nonlinear effects. This review covers the basic idea and overview of such nonlinear phenomena, especially those corresponding to extended states. This includes "swallowtail" loop structures of the energy band, Bloch states with multiple periodicity, and those in "nonlinear lattices", i.e., systems with the nonlinear interaction term itself being a periodic function in space.},

Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

	Abstract = {Evidence for Bose-Einstein condensation of a gas of spin-polarized Li-7 atoms is reported. Atoms confined to a permanent-magnet trap are laser cooled to 200 mu K and are then evaporatively cooled to lower temperatures. Phase-space densities consistent with quantum degeneracy are measured for temperatures in the range of 100 to 400 nK. At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate,for total trap numbers as high as 2 X 10(5) atoms. For Li-7, the spin-triplet s-wave scattering length is known to be negative, corresponding to an attractive interatomic interaction. Previously, Bose-Einstein condensation was predicted not to occur in such a system.},

	Abstract = {Ongoing work aimed at developing highly efficient methods of populating a chosen sublevel of an energy level highlights the need to understand off-resonant effects in coherent excitation. This motivated us to re-examine some aspects of the theory of coherent excitation in a three-state system with a view to obtaining algebraic expressions for off-resonant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Earlier work gives simple closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues this system, expressions applying even when the system is not on two-photon resonance. We present here expressions of similar simplicity for the components of the normalised eigenvectors. The analytic properties of these components explain the observed sensitivity of the stimulated-Raman-adiabatic-passage process (STIRAP) to the condition of two-photon resonance. None of the eigenstates is 'trapped' or 'dark' unless the system is on two-photon resonance; off resonance, all states have nonzero projections on the unperturbed intermediate state. A simple argument shows that no dressed state can be adiabatically connected to both the unperturbed initial and final states when the system is off two-photon resonance. That is, adiabatic transfer from initial to final state requires that these be degenerate before and after the STIRAP pulse sequence, and this implies zero two-photon detuning. However, substantial transfer probabilities are observed experimentally for very small two-photon detunings. We show that such systems are characterised by very sharp avoided crossings of two eigenvalues, and that the observed population transfer can be understood as an effect of non adiabatic transitions occurring at the avoided crossings.},

	Abstract = {STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) has proven to be an efficient and robust technique for transferring population in a three-level system without populating the intermediate state. Here we show that the counterintuitive pulse sequence in STIRAP, in which the Stokes pulse precedes the pump, emerges automatically from a variant of optimal control theory we have previously called ``local'' optimization. Since local optimization is a well-defined, automated computational procedure, this opens the door to automated computation of generalized STIRAP schemes in arbitrarily complicated N-level coupling situations. If the coupling is sequential, a simple qualitative extension of STIRAP emerges: the Stokes pulse precedes the pump as in the three-level system. But, in addition, spanning both the Stokes and pump pulses are pulses corresponding to the transitions between the N-2 intermediate states with intensities about an order of magnitude greater than those of the Stokes and pump pulses. This scheme is amazingly robust, leading to almost 100% population transfer with significantly less population transfer to the N-2 intermediate states than in previously proposed extensions of STIRAP.},

@article{CT:Nore_pof_1997,
	Abstract = {Superfluid turbulence is studied using numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE), which is the correct equation of motion for superflows at low temperatures. This equation depends on two parameters: the sound velocity and the coherence length. It naturally contains nonsingular quantized vortex lines. The NLSE mass, momentum, and energy conservation relations are derived in hydrodynamic form. The total energy is decomposed into an incompressible kinetic part, and other parts that correspond to acoustic excitations. The corresponding energy spectra are defined and computed numerically in the case of the two-dimensional vortex solution. A preparation method, generating initial data reproducing the vorticity dynamics of any three-dimensional flow with Clebsch representation is given and is applied to the Taylor-Green (TG) vortex. The NLSE TG vortex is studied with resolutions up to 512(3). The energetics of the flow is found to be remarkably similar to that of the viscous TG vortex. The rate of the (irreversible) transfer of kinetic energy into other energy components is comparable, both in magnitude and time scale, to the energy dissipation of the viscous flow. This transfer rate depends weakly on the coherence length. At the moment of maximum energy dissipation, the energy spectrum follows a power law compatible with Kolmogorov's -5/3 value. Physical-space visualizations show that the vorticity dynamics of the superflow is similar to that of the viscous flow in which vortex reconnection events play a major role. It is argued that there may be some amount of universality of reconnection processes, because of topological constraints. Some preliminary support for this conjecture is given in the special case of secondary instabilities of round jets. The experimental implications of the close analogy between superfluid and viscous decaying turbulence are discussed. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases in traps is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Mean-field theory provides a framework to understand the main features of the condensation and the role of interactions between particles. Various properties of these systems are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the collective oscillations and the dynamics of the expansion, the condensate fraction and the thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach. [S0034-6861(99)00103-8].},

	Abstract = {A second-order expansion of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the interaction parameter determines the thermodynamic critical angular velocity Omega(c) for the creation of a vortex in a small axisymmetric condensate. Similarly, a second-order expansion of the Bogoliubov equations determines the (negative) frequency omega(a) of the anomalous mode. Although Omega(c) = -omega(a) through first order, the second-order contributions ensure that the absolute value \omega(a)\ is always smaller than the critical angular velocity Omega(c). With increasing external rotation Omega, the dynamical instability of the condensate with a vortex disappears at Omega* = \omega(a)\, whereas the vortex state becomes energetically stable at the larger value Omega(c). Both second-order contributions depend explicitly on the axial anisotropy of the trap. The appearance of a local minimum of the free energy for a vortex at the center determines the metastable angular velocity Omega(m). A variational calculation yields Omega(m) = \omega(a)\ to first order (hence Omega(m) also coincides with the critical angular velocity Omega(c) to this order). Qualitatively, the scenario for the onset of stability in the weak-coupling limit is the same as that found in the strong-coupling (Thomas-Fermi) limit. [S1050-2947(99)08512-1].},

	Abstract = {We describe the transition to quantum chaos of an ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two laser fields. Under the conditions of adiabatic illumination of the upper level of the ion, and when the frequencies of the two laser beams are slightly different, the system is reduced to a quantum linear oscillator interacting with a monochromatic wave. The property of localization over the quantum resonance cells is proposed to exploit in order to facilitate the process of measurement of the probability distribution of an ion on the vibrational levels. In the regime of strong chaos the time-averaged values of the energy and dispersion of energy are computed and compared with the corresponding classical quantities for different values of the perturbation amplitude. In the exact resonance case, the classical analog of the system possesses an infinite inhomogeneous stochastic web. We analyze the quantum dynamics inside the inhomogeneous web. It is shown that the quantum system mimics on average the dynamics of the corresponding classical system. Formation of the quantum resonance cells is illustrated in the case of a finite detuning from the exact resonance, and under increasing of the wave amplitude. The parameters of the model and the initial conditions are close to the real physical situation which can be realized in the system of cold trapped ion perturbed by two lasers fields with close frequencies.

We derive and describe an appropriate semiclassical limit to such a nonlinear Schrodinger equation, using a semiclassical interpretation of the Wigner function, and relate this to the hydrodynamic limit of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation used in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation. We investigate a specific example of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with such a chaotic potential, the one-dimensional delta-kicked harmonic oscillator, and its semiclassical limit, discovering in the process an interesting interference effect, where increasing the strength of the repulsive nonlinearity promotes localization of the wave function. We explore the feasibility of an experimental realization of such a system in a Bose-Einstein condensate experiment, giving a concrete proposal of how to implement such a configuration, and considering the problem of condensate depletion.},

The atomic dynamics inside the guide is analyzed by solving the Boltzmann equation with two different approaches: an approximate analytical ansatz and a Monte-Carlo simulation. Within their domain of validity, these two methods are found to be in very good agreement with each other. They allow us to determine how the phase-space density and the flux of the beam vary along its direction of propagation. We find a significant increase for the phase-space density along the guide for realistic experimental parameters. By extrapolation, we estimate the length of the beam needed to reach quantum degeneracy.},

The density operator of the system rho is obtained as the stochastic average of particular operators \psi (1)][psi (2)\ of the system. The states \psi (1,2)] are either Fock states \N:phi (1,2)] or coherent states [coh: phi (1,2)] With each particle in the state phi (1,2)(x). We determine the conditions on the evolution of phi (1,2), which involves a stochastic element, under which we recover the exact evolution of rho. We discuss various possible implementations of these conditions. The well known positive P representation arises as a particular case of the coherent state ansatz. We treat numerically two examples: a two-mode system and a one-dimensional harmonically confined gas. These examples, together with an analytical estimate of the noise, show that the Fock state ansatz is the most promising one in terms of precision and stability of the numerical solution.},

We observe that the steady states of the condensate correspond to an elliptic cloud, stationary in the rotating frame. These steady states depend nonlinearly on the stirring parameters (amplitude and frequency), and various solutions can be reached experimentally depending on the path followed in this parameter space. These states can be dynamically unstable and we observe that such instabilities lead to vortex nucleation in the condensate.},

Variation of the transverse confinement leads from the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) regime, where solitons are stable, to 2D (or 3D) confinement, where soliton stripes are subject to a transverse modulational instability known as the "snake instability." We present numerical evidence of a regime of intermediate confinement where solitons decay into single, deformed vortices with solitonic properties rather than vortex pairs as associated with the "snake" metaphor. Further relaxing the transverse confinement leads to the production of two and then three vortices, which correlates perfectly with a Bogoliubov stability analysis. The decay of a stationary dark soliton (or, planar node) into a single solitonic vortex is predicted to be experimentally observable in a 3D harmonically confined dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensate.},

We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this discussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of: How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work? How long did it take you and why? We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what makes BEC in a dilute gas so interesting, unique, and experimentally challenging(1).},

Of the two solutions, the one that includes a condensate has a lower free energy at all temperatures. However, the Hartree-Fock scheme neglects the presence of phonons within the system, and when we allow for the possibility of phonons we are unable to find condensed solutions; the uncondensed solutions, on the other hand, are valid also in the latter, more general scheme.

Our approach involves the derivation of a simplified quantum kinetic theory, in which all processes are treated locally. It is shown that this kinetic theory can then be transformed into a number of phase-space representations, of which the Wigner function description, although approximate, is shown to be the most advantageous. In this description, the quantum kinetic master equation takes the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with noise and damping added according to a well defined prescription - an equation we call the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation . From this, a very simplified description we call the phenomenological growth equation can be derived. We use this equation to study (i) the nucleation and growth of vortex lattices, and (ii) nonlinear losses in a hydrogen condensate, which it is shown can lead to a curious instability phenomenon.},

These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that a vortex can be continuously created in a Bose-Einstein condensate with hyperfine spin F = 2 in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap by reversing the axial magnetic field adiabatically. It may be speculated that the condensate cannot be confined in the trap since the weak-field seeking state makes transitions to the neutral and the strong-field seeking states due to the degeneracy of these states along the vortex axis when the axial field vanishes. We have solved the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically with given external magnetic fields to show that this is not the case. It is shown that a considerable fraction of the condensate remains in the trap even when the axial field is reversed rather slowly. This scenario is also analysed in the presence of an optical plug along the vortex axis. Then the condensate remains within the F-z = 2 manifold, with respect to the local magnetic field, throughout the formation of a vortex and hence the loss of atoms does not take place.},

A 61, 063610 (2000)] an optical plug along the vortex axis has been introduced to avoid Majorana flips, which take place when the external magnetic field vanishes along the vortex axis while it is created. In the present work, in contrast, we study the same scenario without introducing the optical plug. The magnetic field vanishes only in the center of the vortex at a certain moment of the evolution and hence we expect that the system will lose only a fraction of the atoms by Majorana flips even in the absence of an optical plug. Our conjecture is justified by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, where the full spinor degrees of freedom of the order parameter are properly taken into account. A significant simplification of the experimental realization of the scenario is attained by the omission of the optical plug.},

	Abstract = {The advancement of high-power and short-pulse laser technology in the past two decades has generated considerable interest in the study of multiphoton and very high-order nonlinear optical processes of atomic and molecular systems in intense and superintense laser fields, leading to the discovery of a host of novel strong-field phenomena which cannot be understood by the conventional perturbation theory. The Floquet theorem and the time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian method are powerful theoretical framework for the study of bound-bound multiphoton transitions driven by periodically time-dependent fields. However, there are a number of significant strong-field processes cannot be directly treated by the conventional Floquet methods. In this review article, we discuss several recent developments of generalized Floquet theorems, formalisms, and quasienergy methods, beyond the conventional Floquet theorem, for accurate nonperturbative treatment of a broad range of strong-field atomic and molecular processes and phenomena of current interests. Topics covered include (a) artificial intelligence (AI)-most-probable-path approach (MPPA) for effective treatment of ultralarge Floquet matrix problem; (b) non-Hermitian Floquet formalisms and complex quasienergy methods for nonperturbative treatment of bound-free and free-free processes such as multiphoton ionization (MPI) and above-threshold ionization (ATI) of atoms and molecules, multiphoton dissociation (MPD) and above-threshold dissociation (ATD) of molecules, chemical bond softening and hardening, charge-resonance enhanced ionization (CREI) of molecular ions, and multiple high-order harmonic generation (HHG), etc.; (c) many-mode Floquet theorem (MMFT) for exact treatment of multiphoton processes in multi-color laser fields with nonperiodic time-dependent Hamiltonian; (d) Floquet-Liouville supermatrix (FLSM) formalism for exact nonperturbative treatment of time-dependent Liouville equation (allowing for relaxations and dephasing mechanisms) and high-order nonlinear optical processes (such as intensity-dependent nonlinear optical susceptibilities and multiphoton resonance fluorescence, etc.); (e) generalized Floquet approaches for the treatment of nonadiabatic and complex geometric phases involving multiphoton transitions; (f) generalized Floquet techniques for the treatment of multiphoton processes in intense laser pulse fields with nonperiodic time-dependent Hamiltonians; (g) Floquet formulations of time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent current DFT for nonperturbative treatment of multiphoton processes of many-electron quantum systems in periodic or polychromatic (quasiperiodic) laser fields. For each generalized Floquet approach, we present also the corresponding development of new computational techniques for facilitating the study of strong-field processes and phenomena. The advancement of these generalized Floquet formalisms and quasienergy methods provides powerful new theoretical frameworks and accurate computational methods for nonperturbative and ab initio treatment of a wide range of interesting and challenging laser-induced chemical and physical processes and insightful exploration of strong-field atomic and molecular physics.

	Abstract = {Topological phase imprinting is a unique technique for vortex formation in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of an alkali-metal gas, in that it does not involve rotation: the BEC is trapped in a quadrupole field with a uniform bias field which is reversed adiabatically leading to vortex formation at the center of the magnetic trap. The scenario has been experimentally verified by Leanhardt et al. employing Na-23 atoms. Recently similar experiments have been conducted by Hirotani et al. in which a BEC of Rb-87 atoms was used. In the latter experiments the authors found that fine-tuning of the field reverse time T-rev is required to achieve stable vortex formation. Otherwise, they often observed vortex fragmentation or a condensate without a vortex. It is shown in this paper that this behavior can be attributed to the heavy mass of the Rb atom. The confining potential, which depends on the eigenvalue m(B) of the hyperfine spin F along the magnetic field, is now shifted by the gravitational field perpendicular to the vortex line. Then the positions of two weak-field-seeking states with m(B)=1 and 2 deviate from each other. This effect is more prominent for BECs with a heavy atomic mass, for which the deviation is greater and, moreover, the Thomas-Fermi radius is smaller. We found, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically, that two condensates interact in a very complicated way leading to fragmentation of vortices, unless T-rev is properly tuned.},

	Abstract = {We consider the splitting mechanism of a multiply charged vortex into singly charged vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a harmonic potential at zero temperature. The Bogoliubov equations support unstable modes with complex eigenfrequencies (CE modes), which cause the splitting instability without the influence of thermal atoms. The investigation of the excitation spectra shows that the negative-energy (NE) mode plays an important role in the appearance of the CE modes. The configuration of vortices in splitting is determined by the angular momentum of the associated NE mode. This structure has also been confirmed by the numerical simulation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation.},

We find that the velocity of the propagation of sound wave packets decreases with increasing optical lattice depth, as predicted by the Bogoliubov theory. The strong interplay between nonlinearities and the periodicity of the external potential generates phenomena that are not present in the uniform case. Shock waves, for instance, can propagate slower than sound waves, due to the negative curvature of the dispersion relation. Moreover, nonlinear corrections to the Bogoliubov theory appear to be important even with very small density perturbations, inducing a saturation of the amplitude of the sound signal.},

	Abstract = {We study vortices in a radially inhomogeneous superfluid, as realized by a trapped degenerate Bose gas in a uniaxially symmetric potential. We show that, in contrast to a homogeneous superfluid, an off-axis vortex corresponds to an anisotropic superflow whose profile strongly depends on the distance to the trap axis. One consequence of this superflow anisotropy is vortex precession about the trap axis in the absence of an imposed rotation. In the complementary regime of a finite prescribed rotation, we compute the minimum-energy vortex density, showing that in the rapid-rotation limit it is extremely uniform, despite a strongly inhomogeneous (nearly) Thomas-Fermi condensate density rho(s)(r). The weak radially dependent contribution [proportional todel(2) ln rho(s)(r)] to the vortex distribution, that vanishes with the number of vortices N-v as 1/N-v, arises from the interplay between vortex quantum discreteness (namely their inability to faithfully support the imposed rigid-body rotation) and the inhomogeneous superfluid density. This leads to an enhancement of the vortex density at the center of a typical concave trap, a prediction that is in quantitative agreement with recent experiments. One striking consequence of the inhomogeneous vortex distribution is an azimuthally directed, radially shearing superflow.},

	Abstract = {A trapped degenerate Bose gas exhibits superfluidity with spatially nonuniform superfluid density. We show that the vortex distribution in such a highly inhomogeneous rotating superfluid is nevertheless nearly uniform. The inhomogeneity in vortex density, which diminishes in the rapid-rotation limit, is driven by the discrete way vortices impart angular momentum to the superfluid. This effect favors the highest vortex density in regions where the superfluid density is most uniform (e.g., the center of a harmonically trapped gas). A striking consequence of this is that the boson velocity deviates from a rigid-body form exhibiting a radial-shear flow past the vortex lattice.},

Two forms of the condensate wave function are explored: (i) the lowest Landau level (LLL) wave function with a regular lattice of vortices multiplied by a slowly varying envelope function, which gives rise to components in higher Landau levels; (ii) the LLL wave function with a nonuniform vortex lattice. From variational calculations, we find it most favorable energetically to retain the LLL form of the wave function but to allow the vortices to deviate slightly from a regular lattice.

The phase diagram of the system is obtained. We find that under certain conditions the system will exhibit a phase transition which is a consequence of the competition between interlayer coherent hopping and the interlayer density-density interaction. In one phase the vortices in one layer coincide with those in the other layer. In another phase two sets of vortex lattices are staggered, and as a result the quantum tunneling between two layers is suppressed. To obtain the phase diagram we use the quantum Hall mean field and Thomas-Fermi mean field theories. Two different criteria for the transition taking place are obtained, which reveals some fundamental differences between these two mean-field states. The sliding mode excitation is also discussed.},

Recent interest in systems with a two-photon coupling prompted an investigation of the structure of two-photon terms in RWA Hamiltonians. In carrying through the derivation, an interaction with adiabatic elimination was discovered. It is shown that adiabatic elimination must be performed before application of the RWA, else terms are dropped that ought to be retained.

	Abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a numerical algorithm for the efficient truncation of the Hilbert space of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems based on a rather general decimation prescription. This algorithm has achieved unprecedented precision in the description of one-dimensional quantum systems. It has therefore quickly become the method of choice for numerical studies of such systems. Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and spectrally accurate numerical method for computing the dynamics of rotating Bose--Einstein condensates (BEC) in two dimensions (2D) and 3D based on the Gross--Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with an angular momentum rotation term. By applying a time-splitting technique for decoupling the nonlinearity and properly using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique for the coupling in the angular momentum rotation term in the GPE, at every time step, the GPE in rotational frame is decoupled into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and two partial differential equations with constant coefficients. This allows us to develop new time-splitting spectral methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a rotational frame. The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. Moreover, it is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position density in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for rotating BEC in 2D and 3D.},

@article{BEC:Hadzibabic_nat_2006,
	Abstract = {Any state of matter is classified according to its order, and the type of order that a physical system can possess is profoundly affected by its dimensionality. Conventional long-range order, as in a ferromagnet or a crystal, is common in three-dimensional systems at low temperature. However, in two-dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry, true long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature(1,2). Consequently, for the case of identical bosons, a uniform two-dimensional fluid cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, in contrast to the three-dimensional case. However, the two-dimensional system can form a 'quasi-condensate' and become superfluid below a finite critical temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory(3,4) associates this phase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the pairing of vortices with opposite circulation. Above the critical temperature, proliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation of a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms. Using a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength fluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence coincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT theory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in mesoscopic systems.},

	Abstract = {Rotating dilute Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of alkali atoms offer a testing ground for theories of vortices in weakly interacting superfluids. In a rotating superfluid, quantised vortices, with a vorticity h/m, form above a critical velocity. Such vortices have been generated in BEC of alkali atoms by different techniques such as (a) wave function engineering of a two-component BEC, (b) decay of solitons, (c) rotation of a thermal cloud before cooling it below the condensation temperature, (d) stirring with an 'optical' spoon, (e) rotating a deformation in the anisotropic trap in which the condensate is trapped and (f) by creating Berry phase by adiabatically reversing the axial magnetic field. Since the core of a vortex is a fraction of a micrometer in diameter, it cannot be directly imaged optically. The condensate with vortices is allowed to ballistically expand till the size increases by one order before the vortices are imaged. Surface wave spectroscopy and the change in aspect ratio of a rotating cloud are the other techniques used. Studies have been made on the creation and dynamics of single vortex and on systems with more than a hundred vortices. Results have been obtained on vortex nucleation, stability of vortex structures, nature of the vortex lattice and defects in such a lattice. Important results are: (a) evidence exists that vortex nucleation takes place by a surface mode instability; but this is not the only mechanism; (b) the vortex lattice is perfectly triangular right up to the edge; (c) in the initial stages of rotation of the cloud a tangled web of vortices is seen; it takes a few hundred milliseconds before the vortices arrange themselves in a lattice; this time appears to be independent of temperature; (d) the decay of vortices appears to arise from the transfer of energy to the rotating thermal component and is dependent on temperature; (e) defects in the lattices such as dislocations and grain boundaries are seen; (f) transverse oscillations (Tkachenko modes) of the vortex lattice have been observed; and (g) giant vortices have been produced. These will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {An array of square current-carrying wires is proposed to construct a two-dimensional (2D) array of surface magneto-optical traps and Ioffe magnetic ones for realizing a 2D lattice of Bose-Einstein condensations (BECs) on an atom chip. Our study shows that when a vertical homogeneous bias magnetic field is only used, the wires will form a 2D array of quadrupole magnetic traps, which can be used to construct 2D lattice of surface magneto-optical micro-traps. While another horizontal homogeneous bias field is added simultaneously, the above 2D array of quadrupole micro-traps will be changed as an array of surface Ioffe micro-traps, which can be used to form a 2D magnetic lattice and then realize a 2D array of BECs. The dynamic loading process of cold Rb-87 atoms from each micro-MOT into Ioffe micro-trap is studied by using Monte-Carlo simulations, and our results show that the scheme can be used to realize a natural and effective loading of cold atoms from 2D array of micro-MOTs into 2D array of Ioffe micro-traps, and the loading efficiency can be reach similar to 65%. Moreover, the positions of each BEC (or MOT) in 2D array of magnetic micro-traps can be controlled by adjusting the currents in the wires or by changing the additional vertical bias field.

	Abstract = {The dorsomedial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) of the rat brain contains a remarkable population of spatially tuned neurons called grid cells (Hafting et al., 2005). Each grid cell fires selectively at multiple spatial locations, which are geometrically arranged to form a hexagonal lattice that tiles the surface of the rat's environment. Here, we show that grid fields can combine with one another to form moire interference patterns, referred to as "moire grids," that replicate the hexagonal lattice over an infinite range of spatial scales. We propose that dMEC grids are actually moire grids formed by interference between much smaller " theta grids," which are hypothesized to be the primary source of movement-related theta rhythm in the rat brain. The formation of moire grids from theta grids obeys two scaling laws, referred to as the length and rotational scaling rules. The length scaling rule appears to account for firing properties of grid cells in layer II of dMEC, whereas the rotational scaling rule can better explain properties of layer III grid cells. Moire grids built from theta grids can be combined to form yet larger grids and can also be used as basis functions to construct memory representations of spatial locations (place cells) or visual images. Memory representations built from moire grids are automatically endowed with size invariance by the scaling properties of the moire grids. We therefore propose that moire interference between grid fields may constitute an important principle of neural computation underlying the construction of scale-invariant memory representations.},

The theory is used to model the dynamical and equilibrium properties of a rapidly rotating Bose gas quenched through the critical point for condensation, as in the experiment of Haljan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 87, 21043 (2001)]. In contrast to stirring a vortex-free condensate, where topological constraints require that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate, we find that phase defects in the initial non-condensed cloud are trapped en masse in the emerging condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered vortex configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into a regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final gas at different temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied by lattice melting associated with diminishing long range correlations between vortices across the system.},

The zeros of P(zeta) again fix the locations of the vortices.

We show that the scalar potential can be identified as the kinetic energy of an atomic micro-motion caused by quantum fluctuations of the radiative force, and that the Lorentz-type force appears as a result of the motion-induced perturbation of the internal atomic state. For a specific configuration involving two counter-propagating Gaussian laser beams, we relate the geometric forces to the radiation pressure and dipole forces known from quantum optics. The simple physical pictures provided by the present analysis may help for the design and the implementation of novel geometric forces. Copyright c (c) EPLA, 2008},

	Abstract = {We analyze the results of a recent experiment with bosonic rubidium atoms harmonically confined in a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) geometry. In this experiment a well-defined critical point was identified, which separates the high-temperature normal state characterized by a single component density distribution, and the low-temperature state characterized by a bimodal density distribution and the emergence of high-contrast interference between independent 2D clouds. We first show that this transition cannot be explained in terms of conventional Bose-Einstein condensation of the trapped ideal Bose gas. Using the local density approximation (LDA), we then combine the mean-field (MF) Hartree-Fock theory with the prediction for the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition in an infinite uniform system. If the gas is treated as a strictly 2D system, the MF predictions for the spatial density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis. However, when the residual thermal excitation of the strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, excellent agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor similar to 2). Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature calibration.},

Using these approaches we examine the effects of quantum depletion and pairing on the system correlations. Comparison with the directly calculated correlation functions is used to justify a Gaussian form of our theory from which we develop a general three-dimensional formalism for inhomogeneous lattice systems suitable for numerical calculations of realistic experimental regimes.},

	Abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids. However, Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics.},

By using the tight-binding approximation, the Bloch and the Bogoliubov excitation stabilities and the dynamics of the BEC wavepacket with the effects of the three-body interactions are studied. The critical conditions for occurrence of the dynamical/Landau instabilities, self-trapping/diffusion/breather of wavepacket, and localized soliton are obtained analytically. The results show that the boundaries of the dynamical instability and Landau instability are modified significantly due to the presence of the three-body interactions. It is also revealed that, the initial wavepacket width, the initial momentum, especially, the strength of the three-body force have strong effect on the critical conditions which are used to describe the dynamics of the wavepacket. It is shown that the regions of self-trapping, diffusion, and breather for BEC wavepacket in the parameter space are modified dramatically by the three-body interactions. The analytical results are confirmed by the direct numerical solutions of the discrete GPE. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fast rotation is reached when the rotational velocity is close to the smallest trapping frequency, thereby deconfining the condensate in the corresponding direction. We characterize a regime of velocity and small anisotropy where the behavior is similar to the isotropic case: a triangular Abrikosov lattice of vortices, with an inverted parabola profile. Nevertheless, at sufficiently large velocity, we find that the ground state does not display vortices in the bulk. We show that the coarse-grained atomic density behaves like an inverted parabola with large radius in the deconfined direction and keeps a fixed profile given by a Gaussian in the other direction.

	Abstract = {Mean-field methods are a very powerful tool for investigating weakly interacting many-body systems in many branches of physics. In particular, they describe with excellent accuracy trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. A generic, but difficult question concerns the relation between the symmetry properties of the true many-body state and its mean-field approximation. Here, we address this question by considering, theoretically, vortex nucleation in a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. A slow sweep of the rotation frequency changes the state of the system from being at rest to the one containing one vortex. Within the mean-field framework, the jump in symmetry occurs through a turbulent phase around a certain critical frequency. The exact many-body ground state at the critical frequency exhibits strong correlations and entanglement. We believe that this constitutes a paradigm example of symmetry breaking in-or change of the order parameter of-quantum many-body systems in the course of adiabatic evolution.},

When the condensate rotates with angular velocity Ω, one or several vortices nucleate, leading to many observable consequences. With more rapid rotation, the vortices form a dense triangular array, and the collective behavior of these vortices has additional experimental implications. For Ω near the radial trap frequency ω⊥, the lowest-Landau-level approximation becomes applicable, providing a simple picture of such rapidly rotating condensates. Eventually, as Ω→ω⊥, the rotating dilute gas is expected to undergo a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to various highly correlated (nonsuperfluid) states analogous to those familiar from the fractional quantum Hall effect for electrons in a strong perpendicular magnetic field.},

Split operator methods for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation and the Dirac equation typically operate alternately in real space and momentum space and, therefore, require the computation of a Fourier transform in each time step. However, the fact that the kinetic energy operator K ^ in the two-component representation of the Klein--Gordon equation is a nilpotent operator, that is K ^ 2 = 0 , allows us to implement the split operator method for the Klein--Gordon equation entirely in real space. Consequently, the split operator method for the Klein--Gordon equation does not require the computation of a Fourier transform and may be parallelized efficiently by domain decomposition.},

	Abstract = {The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) series and the Zassenhaus product are of fundamental importance for the theory of Lie groups and their applications in physics and physical chemistry. Standard methods for the explicit construction of the BCH and Zassenhaus terms yield polynomial representations, which must be translated into the usually required commutator representation. We prove that a new translation proposed recently yields a correct representation of the BCH and Zassenhaus terms. This representation entails fewer terms than the well-known Dynkin-Specht-Wever representation, which is of relevance for practical applications. Furthermore, various methods for the computation of the BCH and Zassenhaus terms are compared, and a new efficient approach for the calculation of the Zassenhaus terms is proposed. Mathematica implementations for the most efficient algorithms are provided together with comparisons of efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {New efficient and accurate numerical methods are proposed to compute ground states and dynamics of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) described by a three-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with a dipolar interaction potential. Due to the high singularity in the dipolar interaction potential, it brings significant difficulties in mathematical analysis and numerical simulations of dipolar BECs. In this paper, by decoupling the two-body dipolar interaction potential into short-range (or local) and long-range interactions (or repulsive and attractive interactions), the GPE for dipolar BECs is reformulated as a Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson type system. Based on this new mathematical formulation, we prove rigorously existence and uniqueness as well as nonexistence of the ground states, and discuss the existence of global weak solution and finite time blow-up of the dynamics in different parameter regimes of dipolar BECs. In addition, a backward Euler sine pseudospectral method is presented for computing the ground states and a time-splitting sine pseudospectral method is proposed for computing the dynamics of dipolar BECs. Due to the adoption of new mathematical formulation, our new numerical methods avoid evaluating integrals with high singularity and thus they are more efficient and accurate than those numerical methods currently used in the literatures for solving the problem. Extensive numerical examples in 3D are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our new numerical methods for computing the ground states and dynamics of dipolar BECs.

	Abstract = {FFT is a well known and widely used algorithm in many scientific and engineering applications. However, FFT is a memory-bound problem that still presents performance challenges to new generations of computer architectures due to its relatively low ratio of computation per memory access. For GPU architectures, where the data transfers between the host CPU memory and the device memory is very expensive, the memory overhead can become a huge bottleneck for large size problems. In this work, we propose an efficient parallel implementation of FFT on multiple GPUs that tackles the overhead of host memory access, by implementing a streaming scheme that hides the data transfer latency. The idea is to divide the problem into smaller ones, generating several lighter and asynchronous memory transfers from host to device enabling the computation for those data simultaneously. We obtained an acceleration of approximately 60% over the non streamed GPU implementation.},

The precession frequency of a single vortex is measured by explicitly observing its time dependence and is found to be in good agreement with theory.

	Abstract = {We present a scheme that produces a strong U(1)-like gauge field on cold atoms confined in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. Our proposal relies on two essential features, a long-lived metastable excited state that exists for alkaline-earth or ytterbium atoms and an optical superlattice. As in the proposal by Jaksch and Zoller (2003 New J. Phys. 5 56), laser-assisted tunneling between adjacent sites creates an effective magnetic field. In the tight-binding approximation, atomic motion is described by the Harper Hamiltonian, with a flux across each lattice plaquette that can realistically take any value between 0 and pi. We show how one can take advantage of the superlattice to ensure that each plaquette acquires the same phase, thus simulating a uniform magnetic field. We discuss the observable consequences of the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. We also outline how the scheme can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields.},

The most well known example of these is the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) process, which allows transfer of a particle between different states with large fidelity. Here we generalize and examine this process for an atomic center-of-mass state with a nontrivial phase distribution and show that even though dark state dynamics can be achieved for the atomic density, the phase dynamics will still have to be considered as a dynamical process. In particular we show that the combination of adiabatic and nonadiabatic behavior can be used to engineer phase superposition states.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional reconstruction of an object mass density from the set of its two-dimensional line projections lies at a core of both single-particle reconstruction technique and electron tomography. Both techniques utilize electron microscope to collect a set of projections of either multiple objects representing in principle the same macromolecular complex in an isolated form, or a subcellular structure isolated in situ. Therefore, macromolecular electron microscopy can be seen as a problem of inverting projection transformation to recover the distribution of the mass density of the original object. The problem is interesting in that in its discrete form it is ill-posed and not invertible. Various algorithms have been proposed to cope with the practical difficulties of this inversion problem and their differ widely in terms of their robustness with respect to noise in the data, completeness of the collected projection data set, errors in projections' orientation parameters, abilities to efficiently handle large data sets, and other obstacles typically encountered in molecular electron microscopy. Here, we review the theoretical foundations of three-dimensional reconstruction from line projections followed by an overview of reconstruction algorithms routinely used in practice of electron microscopy.},

	Abstract = {The decay of a vortex from a nonrotating high temperature Bose-Einstein condensate is modeled using the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE). In order to exploit the tunability of temperature in SPGPE theory while maintaining the total atom number constant, we develop a simple and accurate Hartree-Fock method to estimate the SPGPE parameters for systems close to thermal equilibrium. We then calculate the lifetime of a vortex using three classical field theories that describe vortex decay in different levels of approximation. The SPGPE theory is shown to give the most complete description of the decay process, predicting significantly shorter vortex lifetimes than the alternative theories. Using the SPGPE theory to simulate vortex decay for a trapped gas of 5×105 87Rb atoms, we calculate a vortex lifetime t̄ that decreases linearly with temperature, falling in the range 20s>t̄>1.5s corresponding to the temperature range 0.78Tc⩽T⩽0.93Tc. The vortex lifetimes calculated provide a lower bound for the lifetime of a persistent current with unit winding number in our chosen trap geometry in the limit of vanishing vortex pinning potential.},

	Abstract = {The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems(1,2) in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes(3).},

	Abstract = {We investigate quantum information processing, transfer and storage in hybrid systems comprised of diverse blocks integrated on chips. Strong coupling between superconducting (SC) qubits and ensembles of ultracold atoms or NV-center spins is mediated by a microwave transmission-line resonator that interacts near-resonantly with the atoms or spins. Such hybrid devices allow us to benefit from the advantages of each block and compensate for their disadvantages. Specifically, the SC qubits can rapidly implement quantum logic gates, but are "noisy" (prone to decoherence), while collective states of the atomic or spin ensemble are "quiet"(protected from decoherence) and thus can be employed for storage of quantum information. To improve the overall performance (fidelity) of such devices we discuss dynamical control to optimize quantum state-transfer from a "noisy" qubit to the "quiet" storage ensemble. We propose to maximize the fidelity of transfer and storage in a spectrally inhomogeneous spin ensemble, by pre-selecting the optimal spectral portion of the ensemble. Significant improvements of the overall fidelity of hybrid devices are expected under realistic conditions. Experimental progress towards the realization of these schemes is discussed.},

This scheme can be applied, for example, to the ground-state hyperfine levels of commonly used atomic species. The resulting flux lattices simulate a magnetic field with high mean flux density, and have low-energy bands analogous to the lowest Landau level. We show that in practical cases the atomic motion significantly deviates from the adiabatic following of one dressed state, and that this can lead to significant interactions even for fermions occupying a single band.

	Abstract = {We present the stability analysis of the dark states in the adiabatic passage for the linear and nonlinear lambda and tripod systems. For the linear systems, using the basis comprising bright, excited and dark states the first two states can be adiabatically eliminated. Subsequently the system evolves in the 1D (the lambda system) or 2D (the tripod system) Hilbert subspaces. The validity of such approximations is confirmed by an analytic evaluation of the real parts of eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobians, the non-zero eigenvalues of which are found from quadratic characteristic equations, as well as by the corresponding numerical simulations. The number of negative real parts dictates the number of variables that can be adiabatically eliminated. The number of zero real parts yields the dimensionality of the remaining system. In the cases of nonlinear systems, we evaluate the Jacobians at the dark states. Similarly to the linear systems, here we also find the non-zero eigenvalues from the characteristic quadratic equations. A distinctive feature of nonlinear systems is the absence of the principle of superposition making the stability analysis more complex.},

	Abstract = {We study the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in tilted and driven optical superlattices. For a bichromatic lattice, each Bloch band splits up into two minibands such that the dynamics is governed by the interplay of Bloch oscillations and transitions between the bands. Thus, bichromatic potentials provide an excellent model system for the study of nonlinear Landau-Zener tunneling, and they allow for a variety of applications in matter-wave interferometry and quantum metrology. In the present paper, we investigate the coherent dynamics of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate as well as its stability. Different mechanisms of instability are discussed, which lead to a rapid depletion of the condensate.},

	Abstract = {Using in situ measurements on a quasi-two-dimensional, harmonically trapped Rb-87 gas, we infer various equations of state for the equivalent homogeneous fluid. From the dependence of the total atom number and the central density of our clouds with chemical potential and temperature, we obtain the equations of state for the pressure and the phase-space density. Then, using the approximate scale invariance of this 2D system, we determine the entropy per particle and find very low values (below 0:1k(B)) in the strongly degenerate regime. This shows that this gas can constitute an efficient coolant for other quantum fluids. We also explain how to disentangle the various contributions (kinetic, potential, interaction) to the energy of the trapped gas using a time-of-flight method, from which we infer the reduction of density fluctuations in a nonfully coherent cloud.},

Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moire patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moire lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles alpha and scaling factors p1; p2 for periodic (p1 x p2)R alpha overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

We demonstrate the ability to detect quantized rotational states with >99% fidelity, which allows a detailed quantitative study of time-resolved phase-slip dynamics.

	Abstract = {This thesis deals with an investigation of the chaotic dynamics of an atom- optics δ−kicked rotor (AOKR) system, a paradigm of classical and quantum chaos. The AOKR rotor is realized by subjecting a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 87Rb atoms to a periodic potential. The potential in the form of a standing wave, obtained from a far detuned laser beam is turned on and off periodically in time, producing short pulses (kicks) of laser light. For certain values of the period between the kicks, resonant effects known as quantum resonances are observed that are purely quantum effects. Quantum resonances have been examined in the AOKR for a series of kicks. For large number of kicks, the width of these resonances have been shown to become narrow. Higher order resonances corresponding to fractional Talbot times have been observed in the system. These quantum resonant effects have been found to depend sensitively on the initial velocity of the atoms. The first three primary resonances have been studied in detail, by measuring the momentum distribution and the kinetic energy of the atoms, for two and four kicks. A sinusoidal dependence of the energy on the initial momentum has been observed for two kicks. By increasing the number of kicks, the system becomes extremely sensitive to the initial momentum of the atoms. For four kicks, a more complex behavior is observed in the system energy. A scheme for investigating Loschmidt time reversal of chaotic dynamics of the atomic deBroglie waves have been described in the AOKR system. It has been demonstrated that the initial wave function of an ensemble of ultra- cold atoms is restored, after a series of delta-kicks in what is essentially a multiple beam interferometry experiment. During the process, the evolution of the system for a fraction of the atoms with a very small initial momentum is reversed, which results in a narrowing of the momentum distribution. It is hoped that the research presented in this thesis will significantly con- tribute to the understanding of the connection between the classical and quan- tum worlds.},

We have performed a number of experiments with an all-optical Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a periodic standing wave potential in an AOKR system. We discuss results of the investigation of the phenomena of quantum resonances in the AOKR. An interesting feature of the momentum distribution of the atoms obtained as a result of short pulses of light, is the variance of the momentum distribution or the kinetic energy < p(2)>/2m in units of the recoil energy E-rec = (h) over barw(rec). The energy of the system is examined as a function of pulse period for a range of kicks that allow the observation of quantum resonances. In particular we study the behavior of these resonances for a large number of kicks. Higher order quantum resonant effects corresponding to the fractional Talbot time of (1/4)T-T and (1/5)T-T for five and ten kicks have been observed. Moreover, we describe the effect of the initial momentum of the atoms on quantum resonances in the AOKR.},

The evolution and decay of clustering is analyzed using these measures. Experimentally it should prove possible to create such an obstacle by a laser beam and a moving optical mask.

	Abstract = {The Schrodinger equation dictates that the propagation of nearly free electrons through a weak periodic potential results in the opening of bandgaps near points of the reciprocal lattice known as Brillouin zone boundaries(1). However, in the case of massless Dirac fermions, it has been predicted that the chirality of the charge carriers prevents the opening of a bandgap and instead new Dirac points appear in the electronic structure of the material(2,3). Graphene on hexagonal boron nitride exhibits a rotation-dependent moire pattern(4,5). Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that this moire pattern acts as a weak periodic potential and thereby leads to the emergence of a new set of Dirac points at an energy determined by its wavelength. The new massless Dirac fermions generated at these superlattice Dirac points are characterized by a significantly reduced Fermi velocity. Furthermore, the local density of states near these Dirac cones exhibits hexagonal modulation due to the influence of the periodic potential.},

Recently, atomic BECs have been used to investigate quantum turbulence both experimentally and theoretically, stimulated largely by the high degree of control which is available within these quantum gases. In this article we motivate the use of atomic BECs for the study of turbulence, discuss the characteristic regimes of turbulence which are accessible, and briefly review some selected investigations of quantum turbulence and recent results. We focus on three stages of turbulence - the generation of turbulence, its steady state and its decay - and highlight some fundamental questions regarding our understanding in each of these regimes.},

	Abstract = {The Schrodinger eigenvalue problem is solved with the imaginary time propagation technique. The separability of the Hamiltonian makes the problem suitable for the application of splitting methods. High order fractional time steps of order greater than two necessarily have negative steps and cannot be used for this class of diffusive problems. However, there exist methods which use fractional complex time steps with positive real parts which can be used with only a moderate increase in the computational cost. We analyze the performance of this class of schemes and propose new methods which outperform the existing ones in most cases. On the other hand, if the gradient of the potential is available, methods up to fourth order with real and positive coefficients exist. We also explore this case and propose new methods as well as sixth-order methods with complex coefficients. In particular, highly optimized sixth-order schemes for near integrable systems using positive real part complex coefficients with and without modified potentials are presented. A time-stepping variable order algorithm is proposed and numerical results show the enhanced efficiency of the new methods. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	Abstract = {Particle-wave duality enables the construction of interferometers for matter waves, which complement optical interferometers in precision measurement devices. This requires the development of atom-optics analogues to beam splitters, phase shifters and recombiners. Integrating these elements into a single device has been a long-standing goal. Here we demonstrate a full Mach--Zehnder sequence with trapped Bose--Einstein condensates confined on an atom chip. Particle interactions in our Bose--Einstein condensate matter waves lead to a nonlinearity, absent in photon optics. We exploit it to generate a non-classical state having reduced number fluctuations inside the interferometer. Making use of spatially separated wave packets, a controlled phase shift is applied and read out by a non-adiabatic matter-wave recombiner. We demonstrate coherence times a factor of three beyond what is expected for coherent states, highlighting the potential of entanglement as a resource for metrology.

	Abstract = {Correlation functions play an important role for the theoretical and experimental characterization of many-body systems. In solid-state systems, they are usually determined through scattering experiments, whereas in cold gases systems, time-of-flight, and in situ absorption imaging are the standard observation techniques. However, none of these methods allow the in situ detection of spatially resolved correlation functions at the single-particle level. Here, we give a more detailed account of recent advances in the detection of correlation functions using in situ fluorescence imaging of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. This method yields single-site- and single-atom-resolved images of the lattice gas in a single experimental run, thus gaining direct access to fluctuations in the many-body system. As a consequence, the detection of correlation functions between an arbitrary set of lattice sites is possible. This enables not only the detection of two-site correlation functions but also the evaluation of non-local correlations, which originate from an extended region of the system and are used for the characterization of quantum phases that do not possess (quasi-)long-range order in the traditional sense.},

In this paper we present a detailed example of a technique to adiabatically transport a single atom between different waveguides on an atom chip. To ensure that all conditions are fulfilled, we carry out fully three-dimensional simulations of the system, using experimentally realistic parameters.

When the barrier height is on the order of or greater than half of the chemical potential, the critical barrier velocity at which we observe a change in the circulation state is much less than the speed for sound to propagate around the ring. In this regime we primarily observe discrete jumps (phase slips) from the noncirculating initial state to a simple, well-defined, persistent current state. For lower barrier heights, the critical barrier velocity at which we observe a change in the circulation state is higher, and approaches the effective sound speed for vanishing barrier height. The response of the condensate in this small-barrier regime is more complex, with vortex cores appearing in the bulk of the condensate. We find that the variation of the excitation threshold with barrier height is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of an effective one-dimensional hydrodynamic model.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in cold atom experimentation suggest that studies of quantum two-dimensional melting of dipolar molecules, with dipoles aligned perpendicular to ordering plane, may be on the horizon. An intriguing aspect of this problem is that two-dimensional classical aligned dipoles ( already studied in great detail in soft matter experiments on magnetic colloids) are known to melt via a two-stage process, with an intermediate hexatic phase separating the usual crystal and isotropic fluid phases. We estimate here the effect of quantum fluctuations on this hexatic phase, for both dipolar systems and charged Wigner crystals. Our approximate phase diagrams rely on a pair of Lindemann criteria, suitably adapted to deal with the effects of thermal fluctuations in two dimensions. As part of our analysis, we determine the phonon spectra of quantum particles on a triangular lattice interacting with repulsive 1/r(3) and 1/r potentials. A large softening of the transverse and longitudinal phonon frequencies, due to both lattice effects and quantum fluctuations, plays a significant role in our analysis. The hexatic phase is predicted to survive down to very low temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Long-range correlations in two-dimensional (2D) systems are significantly altered by disorder potentials. Theory has predicted the existence of disorder-induced phenomena, such as Anderson localization(1) or the emergence of a Bose glass(2). More recently, it has been shown that when disorder breaks 2D continuous symmetry, long-range correlations can be enhanced(3). Experimentally, developments in quantum gases have allowed the observation of the effects of competition between interaction and disorder(4,5). However, experiments exploring the effect of symmetry-breaking disorder are lacking. Here, we create a 2D vortex lattice at 0.1 K in a superconducting thin film with a well-defined 1D thickness modulation-the symmetry-breaking disorder-and track the field-induced modification using scanning tunnelling microscopy. We find that the 1D modulation becomes incommensurate with the vortex lattice and drives an order-disorder transition, behaving as a scale-invariant disorder potential. We show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects. The resulting critical exponents determining the loss of positional and orientational order are far above theoretical expectations for scale-invariant disorder(6-8) and follow instead the critical behaviour describing dislocation unbinding melting(9,10). Our data show that randomness disorders a 2D crystal, with enhanced long-range correlations due to the presence of a 1D modulation.},

Two weak links separate our ring-shaped superfluid atomtronic circuit into two distinct regions, a source and a drain. Motion of these weak links allows for creation of controlled flow between the source and the drain. At a critical value of the weak link velocity, we observe a transition from superfluid flow to superfluid plus resistive flow. Working in the hydrodynamic limit, we observe a conductivity that is 4 orders of magnitude larger than previously reported conductivities for a Bose-Einstein condensate with a tunnel junction. Good agreement with zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii simulations and a phenomenological model based on phase slips indicate that the creation of excitations plays an important role in the resulting conductivity. Our measurements of resistive flow elucidate the microscopic origin of the dissipation and pave the way for more complex atomtronic devices.},

The turbulent condensate shows a spatially disordered distribution of quantized vortices, and the vortex number of the condensate exhibits nonexponential decay behavior which we attribute to the vortex pair annihilation. The vortex-antivortex collisions in the condensate are identified with crescent-shaped, coalesced vortex cores. We observe that the nonexponential decay of the vortex number is quantitatively well described by a rate equation consisting of one-body and two-body decay terms.

By introducing rotating Lagrangian coordinates, we eliminate the angular momentum rotation term from the CGPEs, which allows us to develop an efficient numerical method. Our method has spectral accuracy in all spatial dimensions and moreover it can be easily implemented in practice. To examine its performance, we compare our method with those reported in the literature. Numerical results show that to achieve the same accuracy, our method takes much shorter computing time. We also apply our method to study issues such as dynamics of vortex lattices and giant vortices in rotating two-component BECs. Furthermore, we generalize our method to solve the vector Gross--Pitaevskii equations (VGPEs) which is used to study rotating multi-component BECs.},

In this work we show theoretically that the coherent vortex structures that emerge in decaying 2D quantum turbulence can approach quasiclassical rigid-body rotation, obeying the Feynman rule of constant average areal vortex density while remaining spatially disordered. By developing a rigorous link between the velocity probability distribution and the quantum kinetic energy spectrum over wave number k, we show that the coherent vortex structures are associated with a k(3) power law in the infrared region of the spectrum, and a well-defined spectral peak that is a physical manifestation of the largest structures. We discuss the possibility of realizing coherent structures in Bose-Einstein condensate experiments and present Gross-Pitaevskii simulations showing that this phenomenon, and its associated spectral signatures, can emerge dynamically from feasible initial vortex configurations.},

We find that the observed density profiles of the vortex cores are in good quantitative agreement with numerical simulations assuming no interactions. We analyze the defocused images of the vortex cores, where defocussing is caused by the free fall of the condensate during the expansion time. In the defocused images, the vortex core becomes magnified and appears to be filled after a certain expansion time that depends on the vortex charge number.},

By contrast, most conventional transitions do not occur in infinite uniform low-dimensional systems because of the increased role of thermal fluctuations. The crossover between these situations constitutes an important issue, dramatically illustrated by Bose-Einstein condensation: a gas strongly confined along one direction of space may condense along this direction without exhibiting true long-range order in the perpendicular plane. Here we explore transverse condensation for an atomic gas confined in a novel trapping geometry, with a flat in-plane bottom, and we relate it to the onset of an extended (yet of finite-range) in-plane coherence. By quench crossing the transition, we observe topological defects with a mean number satisfying the universal scaling law predicted by Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The approach described can be extended to investigate the topological phase transitions that take place in planar quantum fluids.},

However, the shape of the trapping potential does not appear to adversely affect the evaporative heating efficiency of the vortex gas. Instead, the suppression of Onsager vortex formation in harmonic traps can be understood in terms of the energy of the vortex configurations. Furthermore, we find that the vortex-antivortex pair annihilation that underpins the vortex evaporative heating mechanism requires the interaction of at least three vortices.

	Abstract = {Fast creation of a single vortex in BEC of alkali-metal atoms at a prescribed position and time is still challenging, even though various methods to create single and multiple vortices have been proposed and demonstrated. Topological vortex formation is advantageous in this respect over other methods in that the position and time of vortex formation is highly controllable. This method requires inversion of the bias magnetic field along the axis of the condensate, which leads to unwanted atom loss due to nonadiabatic transitions when the bias field crosses zero. It is the purpose of this paper to propose a scheme that enables a fast creation of a vortex in much shorter time than needed for adiabatic control time by introducing the counterdiabatic field to avert the atom loss. We further introduce a gauge transformation so that the required magnetic field is generated by manipulating the current of the Ioffe bars, which makes our proposal experimentally feasible.},

	Abstract = {Adiabatic techniques are known to allow for engineering quantum states with high fidelity. This requirement is currently of large interest, as applications in quantum information require the preparation and manipulation of quantum states with minimal errors. Here we review recent progress on developing techniques for the preparation of spatial states through adiabatic passage, particularly focusing on three state systems. These techniques can be applied to matter waves in external potentials, such as cold atoms or electrons, and to classical waves in waveguides, such as light or sound.},

	Abstract = {We study the vortex lattice dynamics in the presence of a single impurity as well as random impurities or disorder. We show that in the presence of a single impurity, the vortex lattice gets distorted and the distortion depends on the position of the single impurity with respect to the positions of the vortices in the impurity-free Abrikosov vortex lattice and also on the strength of the impurity potential. We then show that a type of giant hole with hidden vortices inside it can be created in the vortex lattice by a cluster of impurities. In the presence of random impurity potential or disorder, the vortex lattice melts. We show that the vortex lattice also melts in the presence of the pseudorandom potential generated by the superposition of two optical lattices. The absence of long-range order in the melted vortex lattice is demonstrated from the structure factor profile and the histogram of the distances between each pair of vortices.},

	Abstract = {We investigate numerically the statistics of quantized vortices in two-dimensional quantum turbulence using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We find that a universal -5/3 scaling law in the turbulent energy spectrum is intimately connected with the vortex statistics, such as number fluctuations and vortex velocity, which is also characterized by a similar scaling behavior. The -5/3 scaling law appearing in the power spectrum of vortex number fluctuations is consistent with the scenario of passive advection of isolated vortices by a turbulent superfluid velocity generated by like-signed vortex clusters. The velocity probability distribution of clustered vortices is also sensitive to spatial configurations, and exhibits a power-law tail distribution with a -5/3 exponent.},

@article{CM:Sun_scirep_2016,
	Abstract = {Melting is considered to be one of the most fundamental problems in physical science. Generally, dimensionality plays an important role in melting. In three-dimension, it's well known that a crystal melts directly into a liquid via a first-order transition. In two-dimension (2D), however, the melting process has been widely debated whether it is a first-order transition or a two-step transition with an intermediate hexatic phase. Experimentally 2D melting has been intensively studied in equilibrium systems such as molecular and colloidal crystals, but rarely been explored in non-equilibrium system such as granular materials. In this paper, we experimentally studied the 2D melting in a driven granular model system at single particle level using video recording and particle tracking techniques. Measurements of orientational/translational correlation functions show evidences that the melting is a two-step transition. A novel concept of orientational/translational susceptibilities enable us to clearly resolve the intermediate hexatic phase. Our results are in excellent agreement with the two-step melting scenario predicted by KTHNY theory, and demonstrate that the KTHNY melting scenario can be extended to non-equilibrium systems.},

@article{BEC:Wigley_scirep_2016,
	Abstract = {We apply an online optimization process based on machine learning to the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). BEC is typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is optimal for ergodic dynamics with two-body s-wave interactions and no other loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for real experiments. Through repeated machine-controlled scientific experimentation and observations our 'learner' discovers an optimal evaporation ramp for BEC production. In contrast to previous work, our learner uses a Gaussian process to develop a statistical model of the relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC produced. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique. Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant, providing insight into the optimization process of the system.},
