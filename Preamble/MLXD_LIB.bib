   Abstract = {We use Raman-assisted tunneling in an optical superlattice to generate large tunable effective magnetic fields for ultracold atoms. When hopping in the lattice, the accumulated phase shift by an atom is equivalent to the Aharonov-Bohm phase of a charged particle exposed to a staggered magnetic field of large magnitude, on the order of 1 flux quantum per plaquette. We study the ground state of this system and observe that the frustration induced by the magnetic field can lead to a degenerate ground state for noninteracting particles. We provide a measurement of the local phase acquired from Raman-induced tunneling, demonstrating time-reversal symmetry breaking of the underlying Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the quantum cyclotron orbit of single atoms in the lattice exposed to the magnetic field is directly revealed.},

Our scheme iteratively increases the distance between entangled atoms by controlling the coupling between the double wells. When implemented in a finite linear chain of 2N atoms, it creates a triplet valence bond state with large persistency of entanglement (of the order of N). We also study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian and show that the time evolution of a state of decoupled triplets on each double well leads to the formation of a highly entangled state where short-distance antiferromagnetic correlations coexist with longer-distance ferromagnetic ones. We present methods for detection and characterization of the various dynamically generated states. These ideas are a step forward toward the use of atoms trapped by light as quantum-information processors and quantum simulators.},

   Abstract = {Over recent years, exciting developments in the field of ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices have led to numerous theoretical proposals devoted to the quantum simulation of problems e. g. known from condensed matter physics. Many of those ideas demand experimental environments with non-cubic lattice geometries. In this paper, we report on the implementation of a versatile three-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as hexagonal optical lattices. As an important step, the superfluid-Mott insulator (SF-MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this, we study the physics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across the SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that, below the SF-MI phase transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly, this opens up new perspectives for a lattice-driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring through the interplay of the quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent interaction. Finally, we discuss further lattice configurations that can be realized with our setup.},

Starting from the full quantum Hamiltonian, we turn to a classical description of the atomic centre-of-mass motion while still treating the internal degrees of freedom as quantum variables. We show that the scalar potential can be identified as the kinetic energy of an atomic micro-motion caused by quantum fluctuations of the radiative force, and that the Lorentz-type force appears as a result of the motion-induced perturbation of the internal atomic state. For a specific configuration involving two counter-propagating Gaussian laser beams, we relate the geometric forces to the radiation pressure and dipole forces known from quantum optics. The simple physical pictures provided by the present analysis may help for the design and the implementation of novel geometric forces. Copyright c (c) EPLA, 2008},

In solid-state systems, they are usually determined through scattering experiments, whereas in cold gases systems, time-of-flight, and in situ absorption imaging are the standard observation techniques. However, none of these methods allow the in situ detection of spatially resolved correlation functions at the single-particle level. Here, we give a more detailed account of recent advances in the detection of correlation functions using in situ fluorescence imaging of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. This method yields single-site- and single-atom-resolved images of the lattice gas in a single experimental run, thus gaining direct access to fluctuations in the many-body system. As a consequence, the detection of correlation functions between an arbitrary set of lattice sites is possible. This enables not only the detection of two-site correlation functions but also the evaluation of non-local correlations, which originate from an extended region of the system and are used for the characterization of quantum phases that do not possess (quasi-)long-range order in the traditional sense.},

   Abstract = {Ongoing work aimed at developing highly efficient methods of populating a chosen sublevel of an energy level highlights the need to understand off-resonant effects in coherent excitation. This motivated us to re-examine some aspects of the theory of coherent excitation in a three-state system with a view to obtaining algebraic expressions for off-resonant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Earlier work gives simple closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues this system, expressions applying even when the system is not on two-photon resonance. We present here expressions of similar simplicity for the components of the normalised eigenvectors. The analytic properties of these components explain the observed sensitivity of the stimulated-Raman-adiabatic-passage process (STIRAP) to the condition of two-photon resonance. None of the eigenstates is 'trapped' or 'dark' unless the system is on two-photon resonance; off resonance, all states have nonzero projections on the unperturbed intermediate state. A simple argument shows that no dressed state can be adiabatically connected to both the unperturbed initial and final states when the system is off two-photon resonance. That is, adiabatic transfer from initial to final state requires that these be degenerate before and after the STIRAP pulse sequence, and this implies zero two-photon detuning. However, substantial transfer probabilities are observed experimentally for very small two-photon detunings. We show that such systems are characterised by very sharp avoided crossings of two eigenvalues, and that the observed population transfer can be understood as an effect of non adiabatic transitions occurring at the avoided crossings.},

In carrying through the derivation, an interaction with adiabatic elimination was discovered. It is shown that adiabatic elimination must be performed before application of the RWA, else terms are dropped that ought to be retained.

In the tight-binding approximation, atomic motion is described by the Harper Hamiltonian, with a flux across each lattice plaquette that can realistically take any value between 0 and pi. We show how one can take advantage of the superlattice to ensure that each plaquette acquires the same phase, thus simulating a uniform magnetic field. We discuss the observable consequences of the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. We also outline how the scheme can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields.},

However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems(4,5). The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments(6-9) on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics(10-12). Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase(13) sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.},

   Abstract = {STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) has proven to be an efficient and robust technique for transferring population in a three-level system without populating the intermediate state. Here we show that the counterintuitive pulse sequence in STIRAP, in which the Stokes pulse precedes the pump, emerges automatically from a variant of optimal control theory we have previously called “local” optimization. Since local optimization is a well-defined, automated computational procedure, this opens the door to automated computation of generalized STIRAP schemes in arbitrarily complicated N-level coupling situations. If the coupling is sequential, a simple qualitative extension of STIRAP emerges: the Stokes pulse precedes the pump as in the three-level system. But, in addition, spanning both the Stokes and pump pulses are pulses corresponding to the transitions between the N-2 intermediate states with intensities about an order of magnitude greater than those of the Stokes and pump pulses. This scheme is amazingly robust, leading to almost 100% population transfer with significantly less population transfer to the N-2 intermediate states than in previously proposed extensions of STIRAP.},

They allow us to determine how the phase-space density and the flux of the beam vary along its direction of propagation. We find a significant increase for the phase-space density along the guide for realistic experimental parameters. By extrapolation, we estimate the length of the beam needed to reach quantum degeneracy.},

The most well known example of these is the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) process, which allows transfer of a particle between different states with large fidelity. Here we generalize and examine this process for an atomic center-of-mass state with a nontrivial phase distribution and show that even though dark state dynamics can be achieved for the atomic density, the phase dynamics will still have to be considered as a dynamical process. In particular we show that the combination of adiabatic and nonadiabatic behavior can be used to engineer phase superposition states.},

While the basic theory behind this process is well understood, several conceptual challenges for its experimental observation have still to be addressed. One of these is the difficulty that currently available optical or magnetic micro-trap systems have in adjusting the tunneling rate time dependently while keeping resonance between the asymptotic trapping states at all times. Here we suggest that both requirements can be fulfilled to a very high degree in an experimentally realistic setup based on radio-frequency traps on atom chips.

   Abstract = {We present the stability analysis of the dark states in the adiabatic passage for the linear and nonlinear lambda and tripod systems. For the linear systems, using the basis comprising bright, excited and dark states the first two states can be adiabatically eliminated. Subsequently the system evolves in the 1D (the lambda system) or 2D (the tripod system) Hilbert subspaces. The validity of such approximations is confirmed by an analytic evaluation of the real parts of eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobians, the non-zero eigenvalues of which are found from quadratic characteristic equations, as well as by the corresponding numerical simulations. The number of negative real parts dictates the number of variables that can be adiabatically eliminated. The number of zero real parts yields the dimensionality of the remaining system. In the cases of nonlinear systems, we evaluate the Jacobians at the dark states. Similarly to the linear systems, here we also find the non-zero eigenvalues from the characteristic quadratic equations. A distinctive feature of nonlinear systems is the absence of the principle of superposition making the stability analysis more complex.},

For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems(1,2) in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes(3).},

By applying a time-splitting technique for decoupling the nonlinearity and properly using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique for the coupling in the angular momentum rotation term in the GPE, at every time step, the GPE in rotational frame is decoupled into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and two partial differential equations with constant coefficients. This allows us to develop new time-splitting spectral methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a rotational frame. The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable, and of spectral accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. Moreover, it is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position density in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results are presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for rotating BEC in 2D and 3D.},

   Abstract = {New efficient and accurate numerical methods are proposed to compute ground states and dynamics of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) described by a three-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with a dipolar interaction potential. Due to the high singularity in the dipolar interaction potential, it brings significant difficulties in mathematical analysis and numerical simulations of dipolar BECs. In this paper, by decoupling the two-body dipolar interaction potential into short-range (or local) and long-range interactions (or repulsive and attractive interactions), the GPE for dipolar BECs is reformulated as a Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson type system. Based on this new mathematical formulation, we prove rigorously existence and uniqueness as well as nonexistence of the ground states, and discuss the existence of global weak solution and finite time blow-up of the dynamics in different parameter regimes of dipolar BECs. In addition, a backward Euler sine pseudospectral method is presented for computing the ground states and a time-splitting sine pseudospectral method is proposed for computing the dynamics of dipolar BECs. Due to the adoption of new mathematical formulation, our new numerical methods avoid evaluating integrals with high singularity and thus they are more efficient and accurate than those numerical methods currently used in the literatures for solving the problem. Extensive numerical examples in 3D are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our new numerical methods for computing the ground states and dynamics of dipolar BECs.

We present a scheme, using a Hermite-polynomial based spectral representation, that precisely implements this mode restriction and allows an efficient and accurate solution of the PGPE. We show equilibrium and nonequilibrium results from the application of the PGPE to an anisotropic trapped three-dimensional Bose gas.},

   Abstract = {Evidence for Bose-Einstein condensation of a gas of spin-polarized Li-7 atoms is reported. Atoms confined to a permanent-magnet trap are laser cooled to 200 mu K and are then evaporatively cooled to lower temperatures. Phase-space densities consistent with quantum degeneracy are measured for temperatures in the range of 100 to 400 nK. At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate,for total trap numbers as high as 2 X 10(5) atoms. For Li-7, the spin-triplet s-wave scattering length is known to be negative, corresponding to an attractive interatomic interaction. Previously, Bose-Einstein condensation was predicted not to occur in such a system.},

Of the two solutions, the one that includes a condensate has a lower free energy at all temperatures. However, the Hartree-Fock scheme neglects the presence of phonons within the system, and when we allow for the possibility of phonons we are unable to find condensed solutions; the uncondensed solutions, on the other hand, are valid also in the latter, more general scheme.

With more rapid rotation, the vortices form a dense triangular array, and the collective behavior of these vortices has additional experimental implications. For Ω near the radial trap frequency ω⊥, the lowest-Landau-level approximation becomes applicable, providing a simple picture of such rapidly rotating condensates. Eventually, as Ω→ω⊥, the rotating dilute gas is expected to undergo a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to various highly correlated (nonsuperfluid) states analogous to those familiar from the fractional quantum Hall effect for electrons in a strong perpendicular magnetic field.},

It is shown that this kinetic theory can then be transformed into a number of phase-space representations, of which the Wigner function description, although approximate, is shown to be the most advantageous. In this description, the quantum kinetic master equation takes the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with noise and damping added according to a well defined prescription - an equation we call the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation . From this, a very simplified description we call the phenomenological growth equation can be derived. We use this equation to study (i) the nucleation and growth of vortex lattices, and (ii) nonlinear losses in a hydrogen condensate, which it is shown can lead to a curious instability phenomenon.},

   Abstract = {Any state of matter is classified according to its order, and the type of order that a physical system can possess is profoundly affected by its dimensionality. Conventional long-range order, as in a ferromagnet or a crystal, is common in three-dimensional systems at low temperature. However, in two-dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry, true long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature(1,2). Consequently, for the case of identical bosons, a uniform two-dimensional fluid cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, in contrast to the three-dimensional case. However, the two-dimensional system can form a 'quasi-condensate' and become superfluid below a finite critical temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory(3,4) associates this phase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the pairing of vortices with opposite circulation. Above the critical temperature, proliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation of a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms. Using a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength fluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence coincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT theory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in mesoscopic systems.},

In this experiment a well-defined critical point was identified, which separates the high-temperature normal state characterized by a single component density distribution, and the low-temperature state characterized by a bimodal density distribution and the emergence of high-contrast interference between independent 2D clouds. We first show that this transition cannot be explained in terms of conventional Bose-Einstein condensation of the trapped ideal Bose gas. Using the local density approximation (LDA), we then combine the mean-field (MF) Hartree-Fock theory with the prediction for the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition in an infinite uniform system. If the gas is treated as a strictly 2D system, the MF predictions for the spatial density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis. However, when the residual thermal excitation of the strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, excellent agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor similar to 2). Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature calibration.},

   Abstract = {Rotating dilute Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of alkali atoms offer a testing ground for theories of vortices in weakly interacting superfluids. In a rotating superfluid, quantised vortices, with a vorticity h/m, form above a critical velocity. Such vortices have been generated in BEC of alkali atoms by different techniques such as (a) wave function engineering of a two-component BEC, (b) decay of solitons, (c) rotation of a thermal cloud before cooling it below the condensation temperature, (d) stirring with an 'optical' spoon, (e) rotating a deformation in the anisotropic trap in which the condensate is trapped and (f) by creating Berry phase by adiabatically reversing the axial magnetic field. Since the core of a vortex is a fraction of a micrometer in diameter, it cannot be directly imaged optically. The condensate with vortices is allowed to ballistically expand till the size increases by one order before the vortices are imaged. Surface wave spectroscopy and the change in aspect ratio of a rotating cloud are the other techniques used. Studies have been made on the creation and dynamics of single vortex and on systems with more than a hundred vortices. Results have been obtained on vortex nucleation, stability of vortex structures, nature of the vortex lattice and defects in such a lattice. Important results are: (a) evidence exists that vortex nucleation takes place by a surface mode instability; but this is not the only mechanism; (b) the vortex lattice is perfectly triangular right up to the edge; (c) in the initial stages of rotation of the cloud a tangled web of vortices is seen; it takes a few hundred milliseconds before the vortices arrange themselves in a lattice; this time appears to be independent of temperature; (d) the decay of vortices appears to arise from the transfer of energy to the rotating thermal component and is dependent on temperature; (e) defects in the lattices such as dislocations and grain boundaries are seen; (f) transverse oscillations (Tkachenko modes) of the vortex lattice have been observed; and (g) giant vortices have been produced. These will be discussed.},

We then address the regime of fast rotation in harmonic traps, where the rotation frequency is close to the trapping frequency. In this limit the Landau Level formalism is well suited to describe the system. The problem of the condensation temperature of a fast rotating gas is discussed, as well as the equilibrium shape of the cloud and the structure of the vortex lattice. Finally we review results obtained with a quadratic + quartic potential, which allows to study a regime where the rotation frequency is equal to or larger than the harmonic trapping frequency.},

Then, using the approximate scale invariance of this 2D system, we determine the entropy per particle and find very low values (below 0:1k(B)) in the strongly degenerate regime. This shows that this gas can constitute an efficient coolant for other quantum fluids. We also explain how to disentangle the various contributions (kinetic, potential, interaction) to the energy of the trapped gas using a time-of-flight method, from which we infer the reduction of density fluctuations in a nonfully coherent cloud.},

Different motion patterns for the center of mass are observed and classified from the analytical solution and confirmed by directly simulating the GPE. To show the effectiveness of the LFFP method, the dynamics of vortex lattices are studied, and the numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and extremely high resolution of our method.

   Journal = {Journal of Neuroscience},
   Volume = {27},
   Number = {12},
   Pages = {3211-3229},
   Abstract = {The dorsomedial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) of the rat brain contains a remarkable population of spatially tuned neurons called grid cells (Hafting et al., 2005). Each grid cell fires selectively at multiple spatial locations, which are geometrically arranged to form a hexagonal lattice that tiles the surface of the rat's environment. Here, we show that grid fields can combine with one another to form moire interference patterns, referred to as "moire grids," that replicate the hexagonal lattice over an infinite range of spatial scales. We propose that dMEC grids are actually moire grids formed by interference between much smaller " theta grids," which are hypothesized to be the primary source of movement-related theta rhythm in the rat brain. The formation of moire grids from theta grids obeys two scaling laws, referred to as the length and rotational scaling rules. The length scaling rule appears to account for firing properties of grid cells in layer II of dMEC, whereas the rotational scaling rule can better explain properties of layer III grid cells. Moire grids built from theta grids can be combined to form yet larger grids and can also be used as basis functions to construct memory representations of spatial locations (place cells) or visual images. Memory representations built from moire grids are automatically endowed with size invariance by the scaling properties of the moire grids. We therefore propose that moire interference between grid fields may constitute an important principle of neural computation underlying the construction of scale-invariant memory representations.},

Recently, atomic BECs have been used to investigate quantum turbulence both experimentally and theoretically, stimulated largely by the high degree of control which is available within these quantum gases. In this article we motivate the use of atomic BECs for the study of turbulence, discuss the characteristic regimes of turbulence which are accessible, and briefly review some selected investigations of quantum turbulence and recent results. We focus on three stages of turbulence - the generation of turbulence, its steady state and its decay - and highlight some fundamental questions regarding our understanding in each of these regimes.},

   Abstract = {We describe the transition to quantum chaos of an ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two laser fields. Under the conditions of adiabatic illumination of the upper level of the ion, and when the frequencies of the two laser beams are slightly different, the system is reduced to a quantum linear oscillator interacting with a monochromatic wave. The property of localization over the quantum resonance cells is proposed to exploit in order to facilitate the process of measurement of the probability distribution of an ion on the vibrational levels. In the regime of strong chaos the time-averaged values of the energy and dispersion of energy are computed and compared with the corresponding classical quantities for different values of the perturbation amplitude. In the exact resonance case, the classical analog of the system possesses an infinite inhomogeneous stochastic web. We analyze the quantum dynamics inside the inhomogeneous web. It is shown that the quantum system mimics on average the dynamics of the corresponding classical system. Formation of the quantum resonance cells is illustrated in the case of a finite detuning from the exact resonance, and under increasing of the wave amplitude. The parameters of the model and the initial conditions are close to the real physical situation which can be realized in the system of cold trapped ion perturbed by two lasers fields with close frequencies.

   Abstract = {The advancement of high-power and short-pulse laser technology in the past two decades has generated considerable interest in the study of multiphoton and very high-order nonlinear optical processes of atomic and molecular systems in intense and superintense laser fields, leading to the discovery of a host of novel strong-field phenomena which cannot be understood by the conventional perturbation theory. The Floquet theorem and the time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian method are powerful theoretical framework for the study of bound-bound multiphoton transitions driven by periodically time-dependent fields. However, there are a number of significant strong-field processes cannot be directly treated by the conventional Floquet methods. In this review article, we discuss several recent developments of generalized Floquet theorems, formalisms, and quasienergy methods, beyond the conventional Floquet theorem, for accurate nonperturbative treatment of a broad range of strong-field atomic and molecular processes and phenomena of current interests. Topics covered include (a) artificial intelligence (AI)-most-probable-path approach (MPPA) for effective treatment of ultralarge Floquet matrix problem; (b) non-Hermitian Floquet formalisms and complex quasienergy methods for nonperturbative treatment of bound-free and free-free processes such as multiphoton ionization (MPI) and above-threshold ionization (ATI) of atoms and molecules, multiphoton dissociation (MPD) and above-threshold dissociation (ATD) of molecules, chemical bond softening and hardening, charge-resonance enhanced ionization (CREI) of molecular ions, and multiple high-order harmonic generation (HHG), etc.; (c) many-mode Floquet theorem (MMFT) for exact treatment of multiphoton processes in multi-color laser fields with nonperiodic time-dependent Hamiltonian; (d) Floquet-Liouville supermatrix (FLSM) formalism for exact nonperturbative treatment of time-dependent Liouville equation (allowing for relaxations and dephasing mechanisms) and high-order nonlinear optical processes (such as intensity-dependent nonlinear optical susceptibilities and multiphoton resonance fluorescence, etc.); (e) generalized Floquet approaches for the treatment of nonadiabatic and complex geometric phases involving multiphoton transitions; (f) generalized Floquet techniques for the treatment of multiphoton processes in intense laser pulse fields with nonperiodic time-dependent Hamiltonians; (g) Floquet formulations of time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent current DFT for nonperturbative treatment of multiphoton processes of many-electron quantum systems in periodic or polychromatic (quasiperiodic) laser fields. For each generalized Floquet approach, we present also the corresponding development of new computational techniques for facilitating the study of strong-field processes and phenomena. The advancement of these generalized Floquet formalisms and quasienergy methods provides powerful new theoretical frameworks and accurate computational methods for nonperturbative and ab initio treatment of a wide range of interesting and challenging laser-induced chemical and physical processes and insightful exploration of strong-field atomic and molecular physics.

We focus on the quantum antiresonance case for which the classical periodic behavior is simple and well understood. We show that after a small number of kicks the dynamics are dominated by dephasing of matter wave interference due to the finite width of the condensate's initial momentum distribution. In addition, we demonstrate that the nonlinear mean-field interaction in a typical harmonically confined Bose condensate is not sufficient to give rise to chaotic behavior.},

   Abstract = {Superfluid turbulence is studied using numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE), which is the correct equation of motion for superflows at low temperatures. This equation depends on two parameters: the sound velocity and the coherence length. It naturally contains nonsingular quantized vortex lines. The NLSE mass, momentum, and energy conservation relations are derived in hydrodynamic form. The total energy is decomposed into an incompressible kinetic part, and other parts that correspond to acoustic excitations. The corresponding energy spectra are defined and computed numerically in the case of the two-dimensional vortex solution. A preparation method, generating initial data reproducing the vorticity dynamics of any three-dimensional flow with Clebsch representation is given and is applied to the Taylor-Green (TG) vortex. The NLSE TG vortex is studied with resolutions up to 512(3). The energetics of the flow is found to be remarkably similar to that of the viscous TG vortex. The rate of the (irreversible) transfer of kinetic energy into other energy components is comparable, both in magnitude and time scale, to the energy dissipation of the viscous flow. This transfer rate depends weakly on the coherence length. At the moment of maximum energy dissipation, the energy spectrum follows a power law compatible with Kolmogorov's -5/3 value. Physical-space visualizations show that the vorticity dynamics of the superflow is similar to that of the viscous flow in which vortex reconnection events play a major role. It is argued that there may be some amount of universality of reconnection processes, because of topological constraints. Some preliminary support for this conjecture is given in the special case of secondary instabilities of round jets. The experimental implications of the close analogy between superfluid and viscous decaying turbulence are discussed. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

   Title = {Delta-kicked rotor experiments with an all-optical BEC},
   School = {The University of Auckland},
   Abstract = {This thesis deals with an investigation of the chaotic dynamics of an atom- optics δ−kicked rotor (AOKR) system, a paradigm of classical and quantum chaos. The AOKR rotor is realized by subjecting a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 87Rb atoms to a periodic potential. The potential in the form of a standing wave, obtained from a far detuned laser beam is turned on and off periodically in time, producing short pulses (kicks) of laser light. For certain values of the period between the kicks, resonant effects known as quantum resonances are observed that are purely quantum effects. Quantum resonances have been examined in the AOKR for a series of kicks. For large number of kicks, the width of these resonances have been shown to become narrow. Higher order resonances corresponding to fractional Talbot times have been observed in the system. These quantum resonant effects have been found to depend sensitively on the initial velocity of the atoms. The first three primary resonances have been studied in detail, by measuring the momentum distribution and the kinetic energy of the atoms, for two and four kicks. A sinusoidal dependence of the energy on the initial momentum has been observed for two kicks. By increasing the number of kicks, the system becomes extremely sensitive to the initial momentum of the atoms. For four kicks, a more complex behavior is observed in the system energy. A scheme for investigating Loschmidt time reversal of chaotic dynamics of the atomic deBroglie waves have been described in the AOKR system. It has been demonstrated that the initial wave function of an ensemble of ultra- cold atoms is restored, after a series of delta-kicks in what is essentially a multiple beam interferometry experiment. During the process, the evolution of the system for a fraction of the atoms with a very small initial momentum is reversed, which results in a narrowing of the momentum distribution. It is hoped that the research presented in this thesis will significantly con- tribute to the understanding of the connection between the classical and quan- tum worlds.},

We have performed a number of experiments with an all-optical Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a periodic standing wave potential in an AOKR system. We discuss results of the investigation of the phenomena of quantum resonances in the AOKR. An interesting feature of the momentum distribution of the atoms obtained as a result of short pulses of light, is the variance of the momentum distribution or the kinetic energy < p(2)>/2m in units of the recoil energy E-rec = (h) over barw(rec). The energy of the system is examined as a function of pulse period for a range of kicks that allow the observation of quantum resonances. In particular we study the behavior of these resonances for a large number of kicks. Higher order quantum resonant effects corresponding to the fractional Talbot time of (1/4)T-T and (1/5)T-T for five and ten kicks have been observed. Moreover, we describe the effect of the initial momentum of the atoms on quantum resonances in the AOKR.},

The stability of the resonance is analysed, with the aid of experiments, epsilon-classical theory and numerical simulations, and is found to be surprisingly robust against phase noise. Finally we look into the effects of phase noise on dynamical localization and discuss the destruction of the localization in terms of decoherence.},

The evolution and decay of clustering is analyzed using these measures. Experimentally it should prove possible to create such an obstacle by a laser beam and a moving optical mask.

Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field.},

However, FFT is a memory-bound problem that still presents performance challenges to new generations of computer architectures due to its relatively low ratio of computation per memory access. For GPU architectures, where the data transfers between the host CPU memory and the device memory is very expensive, the memory overhead can become a huge bottleneck for large size problems. In this work, we propose an efficient parallel implementation of FFT on multiple GPUs that tackles the overhead of host memory access, by implementing a streaming scheme that hides the data transfer latency. The idea is to divide the problem into smaller ones, generating several lighter and asynchronous memory transfers from host to device enabling the computation for those data simultaneously. We obtained an acceleration of approximately 60% over the non streamed GPU implementation.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing the dynamics of rotating two-component Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) which is described by the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equations (CGPEs) with an angular momentum rotation term and an external driving field. By introducing rotating Lagrangian coordinates, we eliminate the angular momentum rotation term from the CGPEs, which allows us to develop an efficient numerical method. Our method has spectral accuracy in all spatial dimensions and moreover it can be easily implemented in practice. To examine its performance, we compare our method with those reported in the literature. Numerical results show that to achieve the same accuracy, our method takes much shorter computing time. We also apply our method to study issues such as dynamics of vortex lattices and giant vortices in rotating two-component BECs. Furthermore, we generalize our method to solve the vector Gross–Pitaevskii equations (VGPEs) which is used to study rotating multi-component BECs.},

   Abstract = {The Klein–Gordon equation is a Lorentz invariant equation of motion for spinless particles. We propose a real space split operator method for the solution of the time-dependent Klein–Gordon equation with arbitrary electromagnetic fields. Split operator methods for the Schrödinger equation and the Dirac equation typically operate alternately in real space and momentum space and, therefore, require the computation of a Fourier transform in each time step. However, the fact that the kinetic energy operator K ^ in the two-component representation of the Klein–Gordon equation is a nilpotent operator, that is K ^ 2 = 0 , allows us to implement the split operator method for the Klein–Gordon equation entirely in real space. Consequently, the split operator method for the Klein–Gordon equation does not require the computation of a Fourier transform and may be parallelized efficiently by domain decomposition.},

Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

By adjusting the laser parameters appropriately we can induce a non-vanishing phase of particles moving along a closed path on the lattice. This phase is proportional to the enclosed area and we thus simulate a magnetic flux through the lattice. This set-up is described by a Hamiltonian identical to the one for electrons on a lattice subject to a magnetic field and thus allows us to study this equivalent situation under very well defined controllable conditions. We consider the limiting case of huge magnetic fields - which is not experimentally accessible for electrons in metals - where a fractal band structure, the Hofstadter butterfly, characterizes the system.},

The critical conditions for occurrence of the dynamical/Landau instabilities, self-trapping/diffusion/breather of wavepacket, and localized soliton are obtained analytically. The results show that the boundaries of the dynamical instability and Landau instability are modified significantly due to the presence of the three-body interactions.

   Abstract = {Long-range correlations in two-dimensional (2D) systems are significantly altered by disorder potentials. Theory has predicted the existence of disorder-induced phenomena, such as Anderson localization(1) or the emergence of a Bose glass(2). More recently, it has been shown that when disorder breaks 2D continuous symmetry, long-range correlations can be enhanced(3). Experimentally, developments in quantum gases have allowed the observation of the effects of competition between interaction and disorder(4,5). However, experiments exploring the effect of symmetry-breaking disorder are lacking. Here, we create a 2D vortex lattice at 0.1 K in a superconducting thin film with a well-defined 1D thickness modulation-the symmetry-breaking disorder-and track the field-induced modification using scanning tunnelling microscopy. We find that the 1D modulation becomes incommensurate with the vortex lattice and drives an order-disorder transition, behaving as a scale-invariant disorder potential. We show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects. The resulting critical exponents determining the loss of positional and orientational order are far above theoretical expectations for scale-invariant disorder(6-8) and follow instead the critical behaviour describing dislocation unbinding melting(9,10). Our data show that randomness disorders a 2D crystal, with enhanced long-range correlations due to the presence of a 1D modulation.},

This phenomenon can be described as geometrically analogous to lateral interference effects resulting in periodic moire patterns which are characterized by two-dimensional moire lattices. Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moire patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moire lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles alpha and scaling factors p1; p2 for periodic (p1 x p2)R alpha overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

   Abstract = {A topological insulator is a novel state of quantum matter, characterized by symmetry-protected Dirac interfacial states within its bulk gap. Tremendous effort has been invested into the search for topological insulators. To date, the discovery of topological insulators has been largely limited to natural crystalline solids. Therefore, it is highly desirable to tailor-make various topological states of matter by design, starting with but a few accessible materials or elements. Here, we establish that valley-dependent dimerization of Dirac surface states can be exploited to induce topological quantum phase transitions, in a binary superlattice bearing symmetry-unrelated interfacial Dirac states. This mechanism leads to a rich phase diagram and allows for rational design of strong topological insulators, weak topological insulators, and topological crystalline insulators. Our ab initio simulations further demonstrate this mechanism in [111] and [110] superlattices of calcium and tin tellurides. While our results reveal a remarkable phase diagram for the binary superlattice, the mechanism is a general route to design various topological states.},

We attribute this behavior to a strong hybridization between the d bands on Ni and the pi bands of carbon.

We develop a unified matrix approach for the calculation of the inter-miniband tunneling and Wannier-Stark levels in the case of an arbitrary number of minibands. We study the electric field dependence of the probability of inter-miniband tunneling for an electron transferred through the Brillouin minizone only once. The peculiarities of the inter-miniband transitions for the case where this transfer is repeated are also examined for various unit cells and miniband structures of the superlattice. In addition, we discuss mechanisms and specific features of the resonant Zener tunneling and its manifestations in electron transport.},

   Abstract = {The Schrodinger equation dictates that the propagation of nearly free electrons through a weak periodic potential results in the opening of bandgaps near points of the reciprocal lattice known as Brillouin zone boundaries(1). However, in the case of massless Dirac fermions, it has been predicted that the chirality of the charge carriers prevents the opening of a bandgap and instead new Dirac points appear in the electronic structure of the material(2,3). Graphene on hexagonal boron nitride exhibits a rotation-dependent moire pattern(4,5). Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that this moire pattern acts as a weak periodic potential and thereby leads to the emergence of a new set of Dirac points at an energy determined by its wavelength. The new massless Dirac fermions generated at these superlattice Dirac points are characterized by a significantly reduced Fermi velocity. Furthermore, the local density of states near these Dirac cones exhibits hexagonal modulation due to the influence of the periodic potential.},

   Abstract = {Three-dimensional reconstruction of an object mass density from the set of its two-dimensional line projections lies at a core of both single-particle reconstruction technique and electron tomography. Both techniques utilize electron microscope to collect a set of projections of either multiple objects representing in principle the same macromolecular complex in an isolated form, or a subcellular structure isolated in situ. Therefore, macromolecular electron microscopy can be seen as a problem of inverting projection transformation to recover the distribution of the mass density of the original object. The problem is interesting in that in its discrete form it is ill-posed and not invertible. Various algorithms have been proposed to cope with the practical difficulties of this inversion problem and their differ widely in terms of their robustness with respect to noise in the data, completeness of the collected projection data set, errors in projections’ orientation parameters, abilities to efficiently handle large data sets, and other obstacles typically encountered in molecular electron microscopy. Here, we review the theoretical foundations of three-dimensional reconstruction from line projections followed by an overview of reconstruction algorithms routinely used in practice of electron microscopy.},

Motion of these weak links allows for creation of controlled flow between the source and the drain. At a critical value of the weak link velocity, we observe a transition from superfluid flow to superfluid plus resistive flow. Working in the hydrodynamic limit, we observe a conductivity that is 4 orders of magnitude larger than previously reported conductivities for a Bose-Einstein condensate with a tunnel junction. Good agreement with zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii simulations and a phenomenological model based on phase slips indicate that the creation of excitations plays an important role in the resulting conductivity. Our measurements of resistive flow elucidate the microscopic origin of the dissipation and pave the way for more complex atomtronic devices.},

Nevertheless, at sufficiently large velocity, we find that the ground state does not display vortices in the bulk. We show that the coarse-grained atomic density behaves like an inverted parabola with large radius in the deconfined direction and keeps a fixed profile given by a Gaussian in the other direction. The description is made within the lowest-Landau-level set of states, but using distorted complex coordinates.},

Rev. Lett., 87, 21043 (2001)]. In contrast to stirring a vortex-free condensate, where topological constraints require that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate, we find that phase defects in the initial non-condensed cloud are trapped en masse in the emerging condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered vortex configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into a regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final gas at different temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied by lattice melting associated with diminishing long range correlations between vortices across the system.},

   Abstract = {We study vortex lattices in three-component BECs under rotation, where three kinds of fractional vortices winding one of three components are present. Unlike the cases of two-component BECs where the phases of square and triangular lattices are present depending on the intercomponent coupling constant and the rotation speed, we find triangular ordered "colorful" vortex lattices where three kind of fractional vortices are placed in order without defects, in all parameter region where the inter-component coupling g' is less than the intra-component coupling g. When g > g' on the other hand, we find the phase separation; In a region where one component is present, the other two components must vanish, where we find ghost vortices in these two components whose positions are separated. In the boundary g = g', the accidental U(3) symmetry is present, in which case two vortices in different components are close to each other in some regions.},

   Abstract = {Mean-field methods are a very powerful tool for investigating weakly interacting many-body systems in many branches of physics. In particular, they describe with excellent accuracy trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. A generic, but difficult question concerns the relation between the symmetry properties of the true many-body state and its mean-field approximation. Here, we address this question by considering, theoretically, vortex nucleation in a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. A slow sweep of the rotation frequency changes the state of the system from being at rest to the one containing one vortex. Within the mean-field framework, the jump in symmetry occurs through a turbulent phase around a certain critical frequency. The exact many-body ground state at the critical frequency exhibits strong correlations and entanglement. We believe that this constitutes a paradigm example of symmetry breaking in-or change of the order parameter of-quantum many-body systems in the course of adiabatic evolution.},

   Abstract = {A rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensate in a symmetric two-dimensional trap can be described with the lowest Landau-level set of states.

Here, a similar description is used for a rapidly rotating anisotropic two-dimensional trap with arbitrary anisotropy (omega(x)/omega(y) <= 1). The corresponding condensate wave function psi(x,y) has the form of a complex anisotropic Gaussian with a phase proportional to xy, multiplied by an analytic function P(zeta), where zeta proportional to x+i beta_y and 0 <=beta_<= 1 is a real parameter that depends on the trap anisotropy and the rotation frequency. The zeros of P(zeta) again fix the locations of the vortices. Within the set of lowest Landau-level states at zero temperature, an anisotropic parabolic density profile provides an absolute minimum for the energy, with the vortex density decreasing slowly and anisotropically away from the trap center.},

Moreover, the spontaneous shape deformation and consequently the formation of a vortex in an attractive system depends on the strengths of the two-body interaction and the quartic potential.},

   Abstract = {Topological phase imprinting is a unique technique for vortex formation in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of an alkali-metal gas, in that it does not involve rotation: the BEC is trapped in a quadrupole field with a uniform bias field which is reversed adiabatically leading to vortex formation at the center of the magnetic trap. The scenario has been experimentally verified by Leanhardt et al. employing Na-23 atoms. Recently similar experiments have been conducted by Hirotani et al. in which a BEC of Rb-87 atoms was used. In the latter experiments the authors found that fine-tuning of the field reverse time T-rev is required to achieve stable vortex formation. Otherwise, they often observed vortex fragmentation or a condensate without a vortex. It is shown in this paper that this behavior can be attributed to the heavy mass of the Rb atom. The confining potential, which depends on the eigenvalue m(B) of the hyperfine spin F along the magnetic field, is now shifted by the gravitational field perpendicular to the vortex line. Then the positions of two weak-field-seeking states with m(B)=1 and 2 deviate from each other. This effect is more prominent for BECs with a heavy atomic mass, for which the deviation is greater and, moreover, the Thomas-Fermi radius is smaller. We found, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically, that two condensates interact in a very complicated way leading to fragmentation of vortices, unless T-rev is properly tuned.},

   Abstract = {A second-order expansion of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the interaction parameter determines the thermodynamic critical angular velocity Omega(c) for the creation of a vortex in a small axisymmetric condensate. Similarly, a second-order expansion of the Bogoliubov equations determines the (negative) frequency omega(a) of the anomalous mode. Although Omega(c) = -omega(a) through first order, the second-order contributions ensure that the absolute value \omega(a)\ is always smaller than the critical angular velocity Omega(c). With increasing external rotation Omega, the dynamical instability of the condensate with a vortex disappears at Omega* = \omega(a)\, whereas the vortex state becomes energetically stable at the larger value Omega(c). Both second-order contributions depend explicitly on the axial anisotropy of the trap. The appearance of a local minimum of the free energy for a vortex at the center determines the metastable angular velocity Omega(m). A variational calculation yields Omega(m) = \omega(a)\ to first order (hence Omega(m) also coincides with the critical angular velocity Omega(c) to this order). Qualitatively, the scenario for the onset of stability in the weak-coupling limit is the same as that found in the strong-coupling (Thomas-Fermi) limit. [S1050-2947(99)08512-1].},

It may be speculated that the condensate cannot be confined in the trap since the weak-field seeking state makes transitions to the neutral and the strong-field seeking states due to the degeneracy of these states along the vortex axis when the axial field vanishes. We have solved the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically with given external magnetic fields to show that this is not the case. It is shown that a considerable fraction of the condensate remains in the trap even when the axial field is reversed rather slowly. This scenario is also analysed in the presence of an optical plug along the vortex axis. Then the condensate remains within the F-z = 2 manifold, with respect to the local magnetic field, throughout the formation of a vortex and hence the loss of atoms does not take place.},

   Abstract = {The decay of a vortex from a nonrotating high temperature Bose-Einstein condensate is modeled using the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE). In order to exploit the tunability of temperature in SPGPE theory while maintaining the total atom number constant, we develop a simple and accurate Hartree-Fock method to estimate the SPGPE parameters for systems close to thermal equilibrium. We then calculate the lifetime of a vortex using three classical field theories that describe vortex decay in different levels of approximation. The SPGPE theory is shown to give the most complete description of the decay process, predicting significantly shorter vortex lifetimes than the alternative theories. Using the SPGPE theory to simulate vortex decay for a trapped gas of 5×105 87Rb atoms, we calculate a vortex lifetime t̄ that decreases linearly with temperature, falling in the range 20s>t̄>1.5s corresponding to the temperature range 0.78Tc⩽T⩽0.93Tc.

   Abstract = {We study vortices in a radially inhomogeneous superfluid, as realized by a trapped degenerate Bose gas in a uniaxially symmetric potential. We show that, in contrast to a homogeneous superfluid, an off-axis vortex corresponds to an anisotropic superflow whose profile strongly depends on the distance to the trap axis. One consequence of this superflow anisotropy is vortex precession about the trap axis in the absence of an imposed rotation. In the complementary regime of a finite prescribed rotation, we compute the minimum-energy vortex density, showing that in the rapid-rotation limit it is extremely uniform, despite a strongly inhomogeneous (nearly) Thomas-Fermi condensate density rho(s)(r). The weak radially dependent contribution [proportional todel(2) ln rho(s)(r)] to the vortex distribution, that vanishes with the number of vortices N-v as 1/N-v, arises from the interplay between vortex quantum discreteness (namely their inability to faithfully support the imposed rigid-body rotation) and the inhomogeneous superfluid density. This leads to an enhancement of the vortex density at the center of a typical concave trap, a prediction that is in quantitative agreement with recent experiments. One striking consequence of the inhomogeneous vortex distribution is an azimuthally directed, radially shearing superflow.},

In the Thomas-Fermi limit, the circulating superfluid velocity far from the vortex core provides a small perturbation that splits the originally degenerate normal modes of a vortex-free condensate. The relative frequency shifts are small in all cases considered (they vanish for the lowest dipole mode with /m/ = 1), suggesting that the vortex is stable. The Bogoliubov equations serve to verify the existence of helical waves, similar to those of a vortex line in an unbounded weakly interacting Bose gas. In the large-condensate (small-core) limit, the condensate wave function reduces to that of a straight vortex in an unbounded condensate the corresponding Bogoliubov equations have no bound-state solutions that are uniform along the sym metry axis and that decay exponentially far from the vortex core.

Two forms of the condensate wave function are explored: (i) the lowest Landau level (LLL) wave function with a regular lattice of vortices multiplied by a slowly varying envelope function, which gives rise to components in higher Landau levels; (ii) the LLL wave function with a nonuniform vortex lattice. From variational calculations, we find it most favorable energetically to retain the LLL form of the wave function but to allow the vortices to deviate slightly from a regular lattice. The predicted distortions of the lattice are small, but in accord with recent measurements at lower rates of rotation.},

   Abstract = {Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, and can be arranged into universality classes such that systems having unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near the critical point. One prominent universal element of many continuous phase transitions is the spontaneous formation of topological defects during a quench through the critical point. The microscopic dynamics of defect formation in such transitions are generally difficult to investigate, particularly for superfluids. However, Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) offer unique experimental and theoretical opportunities for probing these details. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of the BEC phase transition of a trapped atomic gas, in which we observe and statistically characterize the spontaneous formation of vortices during condensation. Using microscopic theories that incorporate atomic interactions and quantum and thermal fluctuations of a finite-temperature Bose gas, we simulate condensation and observe vortex formation in close quantitative agreement with our experimental results. Our studies provide further understanding of the development of coherence in superfluids, and may allow for direct investigation of universal phase transition dynamics.},

   Abstract = {We have measured the threshold for creating long-lived excitations when a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate is stirred by a rotating (optical) barrier of variable height. When the barrier height is on the order of or greater than half of the chemical potential, the critical barrier velocity at which we observe a change in the circulation state is much less than the speed for sound to propagate around the ring. In this regime we primarily observe discrete jumps (phase slips) from the noncirculating initial state to a simple, well-defined, persistent current state. For lower barrier heights, the critical barrier velocity at which we observe a change in the circulation state is higher, and approaches the effective sound speed for vanishing barrier height. The response of the condensate in this small-barrier regime is more complex, with vortex cores appearing in the bulk of the condensate. We find that the variation of the excitation threshold with barrier height is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of an effective one-dimensional hydrodynamic model.},

The phase diagram of the system is obtained. We find that under certain conditions the system will exhibit a phase transition which is a consequence of the competition between interlayer coherent hopping and the interlayer density-density interaction. In one phase the vortices in one layer coincide with those in the other layer. In another phase two sets of vortex lattices are staggered, and as a result the quantum tunneling between two layers is suppressed. To obtain the phase diagram we use the quantum Hall mean field and Thomas-Fermi mean field theories. Two different criteria for the transition taking place are obtained, which reveals some fundamental differences between these two mean-field states. The sliding mode excitation is also discussed.},
