Firstly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my family back in the 'mel who have always been there for me, and provided amazing support from across the planet since I started my PhD (and before I started too) --- most notably, to Mum, Nan, and Maria, who have helped so much over the past few years. Next, my sincerest gratitude and thanks goes to Prof. Thomas Busch, for freeing me from the working world and introducing me to the (ultra)cool world of atomic physics, as well as the guidance he has offered over the years. To past and present members of both the Ultracold Quantum Gases group at University College Cork, and Quantum Systems Unit at OIST, thanks for keeping me sane and helping out through the work and writing over the years --- in no particular order: Mossy, Steve, Jeremie, Tara, Albert, Angela, Sawako, Rashi, James, Irina, the magnificent Dave Rea, and of course Tadhg. Next, I would like to thank the Graduate School for all of their help removing bureaucratic dealings from my everyday life here. A special thanks goes to IT \& the Scientific Computing Section, for allowing me access to some very amazing toys over these past few years. A special thanks also to Annie, for supplying me with enough caffeine to get to the moon and back. Lastly, but not least-ly, to Christina for her compassion, understanding, and companionship over the past few years. $*/$
