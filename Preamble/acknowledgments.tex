Firstly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my family back in the 'mel who have always been there for me, and provided amazing support from across the planet since I started my PhD (and before I started too). Next, my sincerest gratitude and thanks goes to Prof. Thomas Busch, for freeing me from the shackles of a boring job and introducing me to the (ultra)cool world of atomic physics ... as well as taking me to Japan for a few years. To past and present members of both the Ultracold Quantum Gases group at University College Cork, and Quantum Systems Unit at OIST, thanks for keeping me sane and helping out through the work and writing --- in nor particular order: Mossy, Steve, Jeremie, Tara, Albert, Angela, Rashi, James, Irina, the magnificent Dave Rea, and of course Tadhg. Next, I would like to thank the Graduate School for all of their help removing bureaucratic dealing from my everyday life here. A special thanks also goes to the Scientific Computing Section, for allowing me access to some very amazing toys over these past few years. Lastly, but not least-ly, to Christina for her patience, compassion, understanding, and assistance over the past few years.

P.S. Also, to Annie, for supplying me with enough caffeine to get to the moon and back.
