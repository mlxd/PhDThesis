Firstly, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to my mother, nan, and Maria who have always been there for me, and provided great support from across the planet since I started my PhD. Next, my sincerest gratitude and thanksgoes to Prof. Thomas Busch, for freeing me from the shackles of a boring existence and introducing me to the (ultra)cool world of atomic physics ... as well as taking me to Japan for a few years. To past and present members of both the Ultracold Quantum Gases group at University College Cork, and Quantum Systems Unit at OIST, thanks for keeping me sane (most of the time).
