\begin{description}[align=left]
    \item [Throughout] $k_B$ has been modified to $k_\textrm{B}$.
    \item [Throughout] $\lambda_{dB}$ has been modified to $\lambda_\textrm{dB}$.
    \item [Throughout] Inline use of
\textbackslash frac\{a\}\{b\} has been modified to a/b.
    \item [Throughout] ``groundstate'' has been converted to ``ground state''.
    \item [Throughout] $g_{2D}$ has been modified to $g_\textrm{2D}$.
    \item [P45] ``three distinctive eigenstates'' has been changed to ``three distinct eigenstates''.
    \item [Throughout] ``i.e.'' has been modified to ``i.e.\textbackslash \ ''.
    \item [P49] ``waveg-uide'' hyphenation has been prevented.
    \item [P81] Grammatical dash \LaTeX  code has been modified to ``-{}-{}-''.
    \item [P6] Modified definition of laser cooling to specifically refer to doppler cooling.
    \item [P7] Modified introduction to Chapter 2 by correctly stating that Einstein translated Bose' paper for publication.
    \item [P10] $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$ arguments are added to integral equation.
    \item [P11,12] Eq. 2.13, 2.21 modified to $d/dt$ instead of $\partial / \partial t$. Query this one...
    \item [P21] Eqs 2.49, 2.50 for energy functional modified to correct form.
    \item [P28] Time evolution derivation in Sec 3.1 modified to remove integral (Eq 3.3). Text clarification added to avoid confusion regarding an assumed approximation with Eq 3.6.
    \item [P59] Eq 3.28 and subsequent analysis modified to correct form.
    \item [P89] Section 5.1 ``perfect'' modified to ``near perfect'', and ``density'' modified to ``density profile''.
    \item [P129] Comments and references add to ``hexatic phase'' description in Sec 6.4.

\section{Prof. Watanabe's comments}
\rule{\textwidth}{1.5pt}\\[0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Additional comments added to the abstract describing the results and outcomes of the works carried out.
    \item I have added additional commentary about the kinetic energy spectra, including some references linking the power-spectra and autocorrelations of signals. An additional discussion is also added for applying the methods to the condensate analysis by considering the classical continuity equation. I think the added text is adequate to justify the use of the classical methods in this situation.
    \item While I think this can be a nice study, I do not see the applicability of the XY model consideration to this system, as I think it does not benefit the work carried out. This is something that can be potentially examined at a future date.
    \item References on pages 19, 24, 66, 78 and 131 have all been updated to include additional publications.
    \item Eqs 4.5, 4.11, 4.13, 4.15 have been modified to the correct form.
    \item While I understand the examiners preference for $\mu$m and nm, meter is a more general unit and so I prefer to keep to it in this work.
\end{itemize}
